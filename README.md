# Recent article from McKinsey regarding Generative AI in the Retail industry - Use Cases

"In the next three to five years, generative AI could add $150 billion, conservatively, and up to $275 billion to the apparel, fashion, and luxury sectors’ operating profits, according to McKinsey analysis. From codesigning to speeding content development processes, generative AI creates new space for creativity" 

"Within product innovation, marketing, and sales and customer experience in particular, the technology can have significant outcomes and may be more feasible to implement in the short term compared with other areas in the fashion value chain." 

"Generative AI is not just automation—it’s about augmentation and acceleration. That means giving fashion professionals and creatives the technological tools to do certain tasks dramatically faster, freeing them up to spend more of their time doing things that only humans can do. It also means creating systems to serve customers better" 

Key relevant use cases (among others):
1.	Generate personalized marketing content based on unstructured data from consumer profiles and community insights.
2.	Structure and generate sales descriptions based on past successful sales posts.
3.	Personalize online consumer journey and offers (for example, web pages, product descriptions) based on individual consumer profiles.
4.	Enhance intelligent AI agents (for example, conversational chatbots, virtual assistants) and self-service to address advanced consumer inquiries (for example, multilingual support.)
5.	Coach sales associates to sustain successful “clienteling” relationships via real-time recommendations, feedback reports, and high-value consumer profiles.
