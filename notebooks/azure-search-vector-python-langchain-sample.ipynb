      "Chapter 10. Shifting to a Challenger commercial model - implications and implementation lessons.  To win today, you need a challenger inside the customer organization. That is the central premise of this entire book. It turns out the far bigger story isn't about suppliers struggle to sell solutions, It's the customers struggle to buy them. Arming mobilizers with world class commercial insights and supporting their efforts to rally consensus for that insight and inherently then for your solution, requires a new go to market strategy. The implications of such a significant shift in commercial strategy are numerous. Sales and marketing must work together, bound by a new common language of disruption. Seller skills, something we covered in depth in the Challenger sale, must be reconsidered. Marketing content must be atomized and lead customers to a clear narrative that discloses what they've gotten wrong. There are likely sales coverage and territory implications for many organizations as more capable sales talent is aligned to prime growth markets. To say this shift happens overnight or even within a single year is not realistic. This shift takes time. It takes coordination among sales, marketing, and product teams. And above all else, it requires strong and continuous senior leadership support. That being said, there are a handful of implications that our research has highlighted as particularly tricky to navigate. What follows is by no means an exhaustive summary of change management paces. Instead, these are a series of implications that many organizations get wrong from the outset. Left untreated, these implications can undermine your organization's efforts to make this shift entirely. We'd even argue that attempting to make this shift without properly accounting for these implications is downright dangerous. So what are these implications? Implication #1 Demand generation. Most marketing teams aim their demand generation efforts at developing leads that are ready to buy. Traditional criteria of balance budget authority, need and timing dominate demand generation efforts. True, while this approach delivers a ready made customer to the sales team, it fails to do so on your terms. This approach does nothing to shape demand and create high quality leads. We call that mobilizing demand and we'll explore it here. Implication #2. Marketing talent. Most marketing teams are disproportionately focusing their skill building in the digital space. While we agree that's necessary to a degree, there are a set of skills related to the consensus purchase that are being overlooked. These skills are the ones that drive a marketer's ability to create and deploy commercial insight. These skills are more important than digital skills because go to market strategy rests upon them. Implication #3. Social selling. While it's clear that sales reps ought to be using social media tools to engage customers, we observe many social selling efforts that amount to little more than broadcasting, or perhaps more accurately, noise. Yet there's a powerful role for social media in the Mobilizer purchase. It centers on challenging mobilizer mental models in social media, where mobilizers increasingly go to learn. We'll explore how marketing and sales need to collaborate to deliver social teaching, not social selling. Implication #4 Managing blockers. Blockers can quickly demoralize your sales teams as they engage in consensus building efforts. Sellers must confidently address blockers and neutralize their influence for high quality consensus to be forged. Far and away the prevailing thought for managing blockers, however, is to ignore them. Rarely do sales methods teach approaches for blocker management. Even rarer are instances where sales managers ask who the blocker for a deal might be and what should be done to minimize their influence. So it should come as no surprise that sellers do the same, hoping the blocker goes away or relinquishes their objections. We'll explore several methods for actively managing blockers in this section. Implication #5. Sales Process and Opportunity Planning. The sales process has long centered on providing a clear frame of reference for seller actions, sequenced in order to maximize sales velocity, create a series of stages that dictate sales progress as well as govern next steps with customers. Remember, much of the commoditization pressure suppliers face today isn't the result of customers willingness to settle for good enough. It's their failure to agree on anything more. Today's sales process must better reflect how sellers can enable the right customer purchase behaviors rather than March a deal forward through the suppliers sales stages. Similarly, opportunity planning follows the same logic. Let's dive into these implications. Implication #1 Demand generation. In this section, we'll take a look at how marketing needs to rethink its demand generation system as a result of the insights CEB research has uncovered about the consensus purchase and the role of mobilizers. By demand generation system, we mean the people, process, technology and data that go into lead generation, lead scoring and lead nurturing. Clearly, this is a large and growing area of investment for marketing organizations, and it's a key piece of achieving greater marketing accountability. The stakes for getting this right couldn't be higher. Here's the risk boiled down to its simplest. If marketers rely on a bad go to market strategy to drive what they put into their demand Gen. systems and how they tune those systems out of the other side, they're going to get bad demand demand that leads to low quality commoditized deals as described in chapter one. Unfortunately, as we've researched all that's been written about demand generation in the blogosphere, we believe much of the conventional wisdom is based on an outdated conception of B to be purchasing. Based on the consensus and mobilizer dynamics uncovered by CEB Research, we believe the conventional wisdom is taking marketers in the wrong direction. If you pick up a white paper from most any marketing automation supplier or read A blog post from a content marketing guru, the conventional wisdom goes something like this. It's an increasingly noisy world, so breaking through to B to B buyers is tough. To breakthrough, you need great content. Great content isn't about you, it's about the customer. In fact, it's not about the demo from a graphic customer. For example, CIO's at companies larger than $100 million in revenue. It's about buyer archetypes or personas and their pain points and objectives. Businesses don't make purchase decisions. After all, People do. Personalize your content to these personas. Be present with your content in the spots they frequent. Say smart things so they think of you first when they're ready to evaluate suppliers. Set up your marketing automation to drive engagement with these personas to nurture them. Feed them content that further speaks to those persona pain points and objectives and whatever they need at that stage of the purchased journey. Measure purchase readiness by level of engagement and signals of bands budget authority. Need timing. Pass those nurtured leads to sales foreclosure. High fives all around. Open champagne to celebrate. Sounds great, doesn't it? Much of this wisdom feels so right. How could this possibly be so wrong? By now, having read the preceding chapters, chances are you can point to a few spots where this conventional wisdom might lead marketers astray. There are three main failure points. One conventional wisdom leads us down a path of creating ever more content, and content quantity quickly Trump's content quality. Coupled with the drive to generate leads and outbound marketing efforts, marketers risk turning off customers who are already bombarded with supplier messages. Two, conventional wisdom is mum on the absolute criticality of upending how customers think of their own business, thereby changing the customers direction when they are learning on their own. That means marketers will generate demand that commoditize their own solution. 3. Conventional wisdom is about better connecting individuals in a buying group to you as a supplier, not about connecting them to each other. So marketers will fail to lay the groundwork for the early consensus that needs to happen about the problem and the solution. Forget about the supplier. Let's unpack those in turn. The failures of demand generation. The first failure point is very straightforward. Marketing creates all of that content in its drive to engage, engage and engage. The thinking goes something like. Be present on a regular basis for each of my major personas in all the places they go for information. Since I've got all that content, go ahead and blast it out through e-mail campaigns and other outbound communications. Deep down, marketers know what happens here, right? Customers get turned off as the quality of content inexorably slips when marketing teams face the pressure of creating the quantity of content that conventional wisdom encourages. Customers inherently tune out suppliers, or even worse, they badmouth suppliers in social forums or refused to take visits from suppliers sales reps. We heard the following spooky anecdote from one prominent demand generation leader who heads up regional marketing for a Fortune 100 tech provider. Over an 18 month period, fully 60% of this suppliers opt in. Customer database has opted out. This supplier was no demand Gen. slouch either. They have been a pioneer in demand, Jen. In a crazy, noisy world, something starts to give if we continue to operate by an outbound engagement obsessed demand Gen. model. On the second failure path, the conventional wisdom. Approach will lead to smaller deals at lower margins by delivering what we call established demand. Established demand is the exact opposite of high quality deals that we discussed in Chapter one. Established demand comes from customers who learn on their own norm around minimum thresholds and then invite a supplier in to compete with two other suppliers in the Price based Bake Off. It's the one of three commoditization problem in spades. These are customers who might have read some of your thought leadership as they went about the research process. But they never had their perspective changed about the way their business currently works. So their view of what they need to purchase is established by the time you engage this customer. If you revisit the conventional wisdom, nowhere are we explicitly confronting customer mental models. However, that's what suppliers need to do to knock the commoditization freight train off its tracks. That's the way to change the customer's direction when they wait until they are 57% of the way through their purchase experience before reaching out to a supplier. In the conventional wisdom all marketers are called on to do is create content that speaks to customers known pain points or that demonstrates how smart they are as a supplier. Recall from chapter three, such approaches do not work because they don't change the customers direction. The conventional wisdom encourages that freight train. Vance based lead scoring criteria detect customers who have budget, a clear need and a set timeline for purchase. Leads that show all of these qualities garner more points in marketers, lead scoring systems and get passed to sales. Two main competitors to extract the best price. What sales Rep wants to waste time chasing that opportunity? This is one of the primary reasons our research shows that the highest performing sellers deprioritize marketing qualified leads. Let's touch on the third failure path, which has to do with consensus. The conventional wisdom would have marketers build stronger connections between their companies as suppliers and people in the customer organization. Marketing creates content that is tailored to personas, on the theory that if suppliers can engage those personas more deeply, they can boost customer willingness to buy from them and that will translate into more deals. But by now we know that individual willingness to buy in a consensus purchase means very little. The conventional wisdom largely misses this consensus dynamic. Personalizing messaging and content to such an extreme leads to driving diverse buying group stakeholders further apart. Even in the best case, this approach will lead suppliers to get a collection of individual yeses, but we know that's insufficient too. It's no wonder that based on CEB demand Gen. benchmarking research, only 3% of marketing qualified leads ever convert into deals. And that's on a good day. How many leads never have a chance to progress further because that stakeholder doesn't feel equipped to help Dr. consensus in her organization around the problem or solution, much less the supplier? Based on CEB research, that's likely happening to a large chunk of the 97% of marketing qualified leads that don't ever progress. Many of those prospect nibbles you get on your white papers, webinars, infographics and demand Gen. emails. Those are nibbles from solitary stakeholders making their daily rounds of industry news sites or LinkedIn groups. They engage because you spoke to their pain points, but they don't come away feeling there's any chance to overcome inertia and create consensus in their large organizations. And that's where the lead dies. Don't generate demand. Mobilize demand. To fix these failure points, suppliers need a demand generation system that accounts for the critical role of mobilizers in overcoming group dysfunction and stitching together consensus. It has to be one that accounts for the peak dysfunction of consensus happening 37% of the way through the purchase, long before sales reps meaningfully get involved. Here's what that looks like at a high level. We'll come back to unpack each one of these in more detail, but the themes will be familiar from what you've heard so far. One, create content paths that confront and connect. Recall from earlier chapters, we need Spark, Introduce, Confront Content for several reasons. It attracts the mobilizers we need. It forms the basis for collective learning at its most powerful, and thereby helps Dr. Consensus. The only way to change the customers direction is by changing their mental models, not through thought leadership or content that is useful to target personas. Moreover, if marketing has created those Spark introduced Confront Content paths for mobilizers to encounter and get pulled into, they are mobilizing high quality deals. Marketing is intercepting and changing the direction of mobilizers before any kind of consensus on the nature of the problem or solution is starting to gel in the customer organization. Through Spark, Introduce, Confront content marketing has greatly improved the chances of shaping that early demand to favor the suppliers unique strengths. Two are just lead scoring criteria to reflect confrontation and connection. Marketing should score leads in a way that gauges how much those leads have been disrupted by content and how well these suppliers content has connected buying group stakeholders within the same account to one another. To do that, marketing will need to tag content according to whether it 1 sparks, two introduces or three confronts. See Chapter 6 for more detail. That's well within the capabilities of content management and marketing automation technology today. Marketing will also want to assign more points for engaging multiple customer stakeholders on the same idea. So as marketing automation systems detect individual stakeholders engaging with content that is more disruptive, either introducing or personalizing disruptive ideas, marketing should also program those systems to detect when that stakeholder has shared that content or when peers stakeholders. In the same customer organization, have engaged with the same kinds of disruptive content. That kind of activity will indicate that groundwork is being laid for consensus in the customer organization. Marketing should assign more points to those leads. Clever design of content with sharing and targeted gating built in as in these skill soft mobilizer toolkit enables marketing to do this kind of lead scoring. Think about how powerful it is to know if you've got a prospective customer who is engaging with content that reflects your commercial insight and who is sharing that with other stakeholders. That's the kind of demand our systems should prioritize. See how different that is from typical bat based and engagement based scoring criteria. Instead of assigning points for purchase readiness bands, which tells you how close you are to capturing established demand that leads to commoditization. You are now gauging how disrupted the prospect is. As well, instead of scoring leads on individual engagement, where you assign progressively more points to content that requires more and more time from prospects, you are giving points for multi stakeholder consumption of counterintuitive content no matter what form it takes. Engagement for engagement sake is meaningless. Marketers should focus on spark, introduce, confront engagement that begins to rally the broader set of buying group stakeholders. Modest points for Spark Content, more points for Introduce Content and lots of points for Confront Content. Bonus points when any of this content is shared with or consumed by fellow account level stakeholders. 3 Nurture leads explicitly for commercial insight and collective learning. Now, when you have leads that aren't yet qualified to be passed to sales for closing, you'll know more precisely what to engage them with next. It will be driven by the likely state of mental disruption and stakeholder connectedness at a prospective account. For example, if you've generated a lead in which one stakeholder who has consumed spark and introduced content, and another lead from a stakeholder at the same account who has consumed only spark content, you might want to put confront Content in front of the first stakeholder and invite her to bring in the other stakeholder. Maybe that's a pain calculator or a diagnostic that the stakeholders work on together so they can learn around a common rallying point. Or perhaps this is where you'd suggest a collective learning workshop, bringing in the sales Rep to help execute. This is a very different approach to nurturing. The typical approach is oriented to feeding stakeholders with a predefined string of progressively more engaging content. Too often, engaging here means content that provides more detail and therefore takes more time to consume. They engaged with our infographic. Let's send them a white paper. Or they saw our white paper. Let's invite them to a webinar. Just because a piece of content provides more detail doesn't mean it's done anything at all to further overcome the customer's mental model or lay the groundwork for consensus. Because nurturing paths are built on customers, most common purchase path, one where they learn on their own and commoditize suppliers, marketers may be unwittingly feeding them content that greases the tracks for the commoditization freight train. How to Know if You're Mobilizing Demand? If you've taken these three steps to reorient your demand systems so that it mobilizes demand, what should you expect? How will common demand metrics move? In the following we layout the common demand indicators and how those are likely to change. This is important to understand because you're going to want to set expectations in the broader commercial organization and even the C-Suite on what will happen to demand as you reorient from generation to mobilization. If you're doing this well, overall lead volume may initially dip because you should be producing less content than you're putting into the marketplace. However, that new content will begin to take on a life of its own as it is more likely to get shared and picked up in earned media. Based on our experience working with commercial teams here, this can take upwards of 12 to 18 months, but you'll see lead volume increase. More important, lead quality will improve provided you've redefined lead quality to reflect emerging demand and not establish demand. That's because you've engineered content to attract mobilizers early on, when suppliers still have a chance to shape how the customer defines the problem and nature of the solution. Now, over time, as your improved content finds its way through earned and shared channels into a broader part of the marketplace, you may find that you get inbound inquiries that don't qualify as leads. You can catch the attention of a variety of marketplace actors and industry players, from industry associations to sole proprietors of small businesses to academics. Inquiries will increase because these players want to learn more about what was under that surprising content. But those should not be interpreted as poor leads or included in any kind of lead dashboard. The key metric to pay attention to here is therefore absolute volume of quality leads. Shifting from a generating demand to a mobilizing demand approach should also increase sales generated leads. Marketing should be equipping sales with counterintuitive social sound bites to help reps engage customers early in their passive learning process on LinkedIn and other social communities. See the implication on social selling later in this chapter. Because Spark introduced Confront Content is more likely to catch attention and get shared, it should boost sales reps ability to source leads through their own social networks. Win rates and deal profitability should also increase. You should be able to get ahead of the RFP and influence not just buying criteria, but the minimum thresholds of performance for those criteria. That translates to higher win rate, larger deal size and or larger margins. Based on CEB research and our members experiences, 15 to 20% price premiums are not unusual for demand that is mobilized and carried through to the sales interaction. It's the same effect that John Goetz, the Xerox account executive, described back in Chapter 5 in Using the Color Drive Student Performance Insight. It's as if the door closes, I'm on the inside and everyone else is on the outside. So far so good. Higher volume of quality leads after an initial downtick. Larger deals, better margins, higher close rates. But what about sales cycle time? There are multiple forces driving cycle times in different directions here. It's very likely that prospective customers will encounter that Spark introduced Confront Content earlier in their purchase journey. They may encounter content in a passive learning stage, perhaps in earned media, before they even begin the journey. That can, in a way, start the purchase clock early if you measure cycle time from the first moment that you have a lead through to deal clothes. All else equal, that might extend sales cycle time. On the flip side, there are also forces shortening sales cycle time. By engaging mobilizers early and equipping them with content and tools that they use to drive consensus in the buying group and surface stakeholder objections early, you canmore effectively build Deal momentum, much like Alpha Company accomplished in its Collective Learning workshops from Chapter 9. That will enable those buying groups to agree on more larger problems and more valuable solutions, and more quickly than if you aren't connecting them early to overcome group dysfunction. Soft indicators of success. If you step back to look at the big picture on KPIs, you'll see that motivating this shift in content and demand generation strategy takes some courage. You're likely to face short term pressure on lead, quality and cycle time as you give the marketplace a chance to digest content. It has to work its way through sharing channels. It has to get noticed and picked up in earned media and by influencers. Mobilizers have to encounter that content, share it with fellow stakeholders and rally around it. As we've talked to CEB members who have been on this demand mobilization journey, they shared with us the confidence giving softer indicators that let you know you're on the right track, especially in the face of some dashboard KPI's that may move temporarily in the wrong direction. You can visualize in a demand funnel. In the pre funnel stage, you'll know you're on the right track if you experience these kinds of things. Proprietary term adoption. You'll begin to see terms that you've coined get used in social media or maybe even adopted by the broader marketplace. See the Cisco example from Chapter 9. Third party references earned media outlets, notable bloggers, and other influencers will start to reference your commercial insight. They love surprising or counterintuitive information, after all. Invitations to present your insights. Rather than having to pay for event sponsorships, you'll start to get invited to present on your commercial insight. That's because your content is less likely to be about you as a supplier and more about these surprising things going on in your customers businesses. If you experience any of these kinds of events, you'll know you're on the right track. Likewise, you should start to see the following kinds of soft indicators in the demand funnel itself. Early engagement with new key decision makers. Your content is winning early Salesforce engagement with decision makers, ones that you hadn't engaged before. Recall from chapters 5 and six how Xerox was able to engage with a new set of more senior decision makers outside of IT. Positive sales force sentiment on lead quality. You'll hear instances of very positive feedback from the sales force on the different in kind discussions that they are able to have with marketing sourced leads who are primed by your content to learn more about your commercial insight and how it applies to their business. Instances of getting ahead of the RFP slash. No bid contracts. You'll hear examples from your sales force of content helping to get ahead of the RFP or spark no bid contract situations. Recall from Chapter 9 how Skill Sauce Mobilizer Toolkit is enabling this. When you experience these kinds of events, celebrate them. Share credit liberally with your team and your sales colleagues. If you've done this right, they were your copilots all along in designing a demand mobilization system. Above all, take courage to fight through the tough parts of the journey. Companies who have moved in this direction, like Xerox, Smart Skill Soft and others tell us the prize is worth the fight. Implication #2. Marketing talent. The chief talent question marketing leaders should be interested in is have I got the right marketer talent to thrive in the world of the consensus purchase? CEB has studied this question quantitatively with special focus on marketers abilities to generate and deploy commercial insight. After all, commercial insight is the key to engaging mobilizers early. If you can get that right, you'll have set your commercial organization up for success against the consensus dynamic. Here's the key take away. Commercial insight, skills and knowledge are in short supply. Moreover, it takes a special blend of those skills and knowledge put into the right operating environment to successfully build and deploy commercial insight. In other words, this can't be left to chance or to heroism on the marketing team. Marketing leaders need to step in to engineer the right kinds of working teams and create a particular kind of environment that nurtures commercial insight creation. Now here are the details. To study this, we conducted survey based quantitative research. We surveyed over 580 marketers in different roles and at different levels from 29 different B to B suppliers around the world. In these surveys, we had marketers self assess their performance across a wide range of attributes, skills, attitudes, knowledge, experience and their work environment. We then had the heads of marketing from each of those companies assess each of their survey participants on their ability across four skills we consider crucial to commercial insight creation. Finally, we then use statistical analysis to determine of all the things you could do well as a marketer, what matters most in building and deploying commercial insight. Here's what we found. First, let's look at the four skills we used as a proxy for commercial insight ability. These are the four skills that heads of marketing scored each of their people on. We looked at marketers ability to one generate insight that reshapes how customers think about their business. To understand and articulate their companies differentiated capabilities and benefits. Three, connect those insights about customers back to the suppliers 's unique capabilities. Four, package all of that in compelling messages across a variety of content types, including sales collateral and other sales support. These are the commercial insight indicators or outcomes we studied. In a moment, we'll take a look at the drivers of these indicators. But let's pause on these indicators for a moment. The first observation is on a scale of 1 to 5, marketers are pretty average at these commercial insight indicators as judged by their marketing leaders. Not great, not horrible, just sort of neutral. There is clearly room to run on improving marketers performance on the skills that matter most for commercial insight. One thing worth noting, when we conducted the survey, we specifically asked participating heads of marketing to select only those members of their team who play a role in the creation of content and messaging. So this is an X-ray of the messaging and content engine itself. When you look at the distribution of marketer performance, you'll find that only one out of four marketers averages above a four. Major deals arise from understanding the customers business better than they understand it themselves, At least where your capabilities intersect the customer business. This is a high bar we're talking about here. When we think about the level of skill we need, it's troubling to see how few marketers excel at the skills required to counter customers thinking. It raises an interesting challenge for marketing leaders. How do I get more of my team above that threshold? Can I shift them there, or will I need to hire new people altogether? To answer that question, we need to better understand the drivers of our four commercial insight indicators. We included a wide variety of potential drivers in our survey. What you see are the factors that mattered most in driving marketers commercial insight indicators. They bundle into five statistically significant drivers. Think of these as categories of attributes that naturally move together and drive those four commercial insight indicators. In case you're wondering about the scores, the number represents the increase in score on a 5 point scale that we'd expect to see if we improve performance from below average to above average. So for example Customer native measures 0.21. That means improving from bottom quartile to top quartile performance on customer native attributes would increase a marketers commercial insight performance on a 5 point scale by 0.21 points. Now you're probably wondering, is 0.21 points a lot? Seems kind of small. But when you Add all these scores together, which represents improvement on all these skills, you see a very dramatic impact on overall Commercial Insight performance. If you were to realize the full benefit of each of these scores combined, that would mean moving a marketer from average level of Commercial insight performance to the top 15%. That's a big deal because it means moving into the zone of creating and deploying commercial insight that can lead to a quantum jump in commercial results. Let's unpack what's in each of these scores. To understand what's underneath these findings, we have to transport ourselves into the actual meetings where these teams are trying to generate commercial insight in the first place. They're looking for potential hidden connections in the customers business that customers themselves fail to appreciate. They're hunting for clues to find these connections. They're mapping customer mental models depicting how that customer's business works and how they make money. They're looking for a place in that model where they can tell customers they're wrong. Then they're finding creative ways to spark, introduce and confront customers with those messages at arms length. That's not easy. So what does it take? Well, First things first, let's unpack the first driver, customer native. What this driver captures is a world class marketers ability to truly understand the customer, their motivations, their decisions, how they speak, what they're thinking. For example, within this driver you'll find activities like hypothesized needs. The best commercial insight marketers can anticipate customer needs before the customers themselves. This goes way beyond asking customers what they need or staring at backward looking data about what customers have ordered. This demands a knowledge of customers that lets you hypothesize what they don't yet even realize they need. That's the key to teaching. It's all about finding unrecognized customer needs. That second biggest driver is labeled investigative. This is more about the posture and traits of the folks you want on the Commercial Insight team. Think of this as a detective type of posture. Always asking why? Sorting through mountains of ambiguous information. Testing assumptions. These marketers are looking for clues in their customers business environment, in their own data about customers, in current market trends and especially in unusual customer stories that might normally be dismissed. All with the aim of connecting information in new ways to show customers how their mental models are off base. Also note the not overly confident sub driver under the investigative heading. There's a type of marketer out there who runs against this investigative posture that you definitely do not want on your commercial insight team. That's the overconfident marketer who assumes he already knows what the customer needs and rationalizes away any evidence to the contrary. The third biggest driver is labeled business savvy. This one is really interesting not just for what it is, but also for what it's not. It turns out marketers with a consulting or strategic planning background perform well on our four commercial insight indicators, and people with a deep background in data, slash analytics or creative design don't. Why? Well, the business savvy brings two things to the table. First, these folks are already good at building and tearing down mental models. That's essentially what consulting or strategic planning has trained them to do. Work through complex and ambiguous problems. They live for that. Second, they bring with them an extensive mental library of business and economic frameworks, how money is made and how business models work in a whole range of industries and situations. That's a critical ingredient for landing on commercial insight, finding the hidden connections that aren't just hidden but economically meaningful. Think about dense ply and the modeling of absenteeism cost on the profitability of the dentist practice. Those are the first three sets of drivers. They all fit under a people heading because they're more about the attributes of the individual people who are building and deploying commercial insight. It's a special blend of skills, background and knowledge. The data tells us it's quite likely that you wouldn't find this blend in any single person. That's borne out in our experience working with organizations on commercial insight, too. Building and deploying commercial insight is more of a team sport. Commercial leaders will probably have to look beyond marketing to product strategy, sales insights, maybe even R&D to find the right people mix here. The crucial implication is staffing for commercial insight can't be left to chance. It's not to be taken on by a casual mix of frontline marketers or volunteers. Commercial leaders need to deliberately engineer the right blend of people. Now commercial leaders also need to set the right operating conditions for these people to work in. That's what the last two drivers speak to and why we put them under an environment heading. The first one of these two drivers is Co creative teams. Coming up with commercial insight is an organic, interactive, synthetic exercise. As a result, commercial leaders have to foster an environment where sharing and building on one another's ideas is not just encouraged. But expected. Remember, commercial insight, by definition is disruptive. Some of the best ideas are going to seem pretty far fetched at first glance. They'll run counter. To how customers currently view their world. Under this driver, we observe that the best performing teams have marketing and sales working together on this, collaborating to build on each other 's experience and synthesize different ideas, and willing to accept when their ideas may not win out. Also under this Co creative teams driver, we observed an interesting dynamic about the high performing teams not feeling like it was necessary to take turns to talk. We think this one showed up because commercial organizations often bring together teams that are too large to generate commercial insight. Four to five people is the ideal size. If you've got 7-8 or more, chances are pretty good you've already made some sacrifices on the people's skills and traits we've discussed. Then, whenever you get groups that large, the team feels compelled to include everyone's thinking, and that dilutes your keen insights. It's the one pizza rule. If you have to order two pizzas to feed the team for late night work sessions, the team is too big. The second of the environment drivers is encourage risks. By now, this one should come as no surprise. Generating commercial insight is fundamentally a creative task, and if you don't encourage risk taking, you're not going to get the lateral thinking and outlier ideas that end up being the richest kernels of commercial insight. If you are to get breakthrough commercial insight, this is the kind of people mix and environment you need to engineer as marketing leaders. This responsibility extends to sales and product leaders as well, given the mix of talent that is required to generate commercial insight. Implication #3 Social selling. In chapter five, we focused on using content to challenge mobilizers mental models early. It's absolutely critical for marketing to do this, but that doesn't mean commercial organization should give up on getting sales reps to engage with mobilizers to begin breaking down the A as early as possible. The rise of social media gives occasion for marketing and sales to work together to create these early teaching opportunities. It looks very different from the typical broadcast approach we see commercial organizations taking to do social selling. One of the key questions that our research highlighting that customers are 57% of the way through a purchase surface is if customers are delaying contact with supplier sales reps, how is it that some sales reps are still managing to get in early? What are they doing differently? So we studied sales Rep behavior to find out. That question led us to study sales Rep behavior on engaging customers early, bringing both quantitative and qualitative research methods to bear, and unearthed an important set of insights. We fielded a survey to over 1000 sales reps from 23B to B companies across all kinds of industries. We tested over 90 sales Rep attributes and behaviors, all related to getting in early with customers. Then we conducted over 100 structured interviews with sales reps, managers and leaders, all with an eye to understanding what separates high performers from average performers when it comes to getting in early. The single most powerful behavior separating high performers from core performers is using social media as a critical channel to engage customers and generate leads. What exactly does it mean to use social media in the context of getting in early? Well, when you unpack the data, it comes down to three things. One connecting with potential customers. Two, using social networks like LinkedIn and Twitter to share points of view valuable to customers. Three, using social media for lead generation. When we talked to a number of sales reps having huge success with this approach, what we found is this all adds up to positioning oneself as a key influencer within social networks. To do that, we found the best reps worked very hard to tap into a large social network extending far beyond personal contacts and current customers. These reps are accessing the entire ecosystem of the marketplace that that Rep sells into. So not just existing customers, but potential customers. Even people who might never be your customer, but could potentially buy your product in another territory through a different channel or through another supplier altogether. But that's just the beginning. Then there are channel partners, industry experts, market influencers, complementary suppliers, influencers from similar or adjacent industries, you name it. Basically, it's anyone and everyone who might be interested in engaging in a conversation around the broadest set of issues your products and services potentially touch. So the best reps Find the watering holes or those online communities where people in their industry gather and learn. In advanced cases, the very best reps will serve as teaching connectors, serving as a hub, bringing this group of people together in order to engage in a learning conversation around a common interest. Done well, sales reps who play this role as Teaching Connector are much more likely to attract mobilizers into their orbit. Now there are clearly ways that refuse of social media can go wrong. The best reps who are involved in social media are very careful how they use it. The last thing star performers would do with this powerful network they've tapped into is use it to broadcast messages with no interaction or teaching. In other words, using it purely as an advertising channel. Yet we see far too much of social selling happening in exactly this way. No one has any patience for posts like. Just wanted to let you know our new XP Nine 100 is out next month pre-order today. We've all been on the receiving end of this kind of message on LinkedIn. That's not what this channel is for. Rather, it's about actively engaging in a productive, interesting conversation. Ideally, conversation that teaches. It fits right into the spark introduced Confront model from Chapter 6. Social watering holes are the ideal place to spark a target audience into exploring your ideas by sharing surprising data, insights and provocative viewpoints. Because commercial insights are by definition not about you as a supplier, but about customers, they are much less likely to be rejected on the grounds of being commercially slanted. One star performing sales Rep we talked to in the healthcare space summed it up nicely, she told us. You've got to weave yourself into the knowledge fabric where your customers learn, but you've got to earn that right. You've got to help the customer think differently than they would have otherwise. Now in some industries, there are more social watering holes and opportunities for our customers and ecosystem partners to learn and engage in conversations. There are some regulated spaces like healthcare and financial services where social media growth has been stunted. But we've been consistently surprised at how far and wide social watering holes are extending to some B to B categories where you'd never expect it. Chemistry. Check. Material science? Yep. Auto dealership finance and insurance? Uh-huh. We're seeing leading marketing and sales functions tag team to get this right. Suppliers like IBM, Cisco, National Instruments and others are blazing the trail here. When it comes to social media, marketers complain that it's difficult to scale efforts there because social media is so time and labor intensive. Well, these organizations realize that in sales they have multiple times the people power that marketing can bring to bear. We view this kind of social enablement as a critical part of the larger commercial strategy to teach mobilizers and disrupt their mental models early, ideally when they are passively learning, but certainly before the 57% point when they are picking up the phone to talk to a sales Rep. Teach where and when customers learn. Implication #4 Managing blockers. There are times and situations where a purchase bogs down. Where a stakeholder is so incredibly entrenched in their own views and won't budge. As we covered earlier in this book, we affectionately call these fine folks blockers, though chances are good your sales teams use far more colorful language to describe them. Blockers readily derail consensus building and collective learning efforts, spoiling any chance of a new view emerging. When we've interviewed sellers on how to best engage a blocker, a litany of hilarious responses usually ensued. Get them fired or football tickets or humiliate them are among our favorites. Perhaps there is a time and place for any of those actions, but invariably the number one response we heard is ignore them. For years, the conventional wisdom has been to avoid blockers altogether, like an ostrich burying its head in the sand, hoping they will somehow disappear. However, there is one problem with that strategy. Blockers don't go away or stay on the sidelines. They are present, either knowingly or unknowingly, in virtually every deal. Depending on their influence, blockers have a powerful ability to stall and derail the most promising of deals. Fortunately, across the course of our research, we've identified a number of proven, proactive strategies to address and neutralize deal blockers. As a reminder, a blocker is a customer stakeholder who tries to prevent a supplier from closing a deal, whether because they dislike the supplier, prefer a competing supplier, or want to maintain the status quo. Like the mobilizer, blockers don't fall into any pattern of seniority, buying role or functional role. Unfortunately, they come in all shapes and sizes with different influencing levels. Making matters worse, the blocker isn't necessarily even known to the supplier. They could be known, unknown, or even what we would call stealth blockers. Those who vocalize support to the salesperson but then turn around and torpedo the deal behind the scenes. With the inclusion of one or more blockers in any given deal, a supplier's chances of making a high quality sale decrease by 47%. As you well know, blockers are present in virtually every deal. Therefore logic would say that from the get go for most deals, you have only a 53% chance of making a high quality sale. Scary stuff. As most sales managers will attest, salespeople rarely engage blockers effectively. Most salespeople ignore the blockers who are lying in wait to undermine their deals, hoping that they can rally enough support to overrule a blockers objections. We've observed the best sales managers quite literally forced discussion of blockers amongst their sales teams. These sales managers are taught to ask questions like if I told you we were overlooking a blocker to this deal, who would you guess it would be and why? The wording alone is smart. The question doesn't allow the seller to say that there are no blockers. They can't default to their natural tendency, in other words. Another powerful question used by managers is what types of stakeholders typically block deals like this. A great question for prompting the seller to think about similar deals and where there might be common blocker tendencies. Blockers are tricky stakeholders and they will state objections that they think will align with other stakeholders. Objections as they don't want to be seen as explicitly rocking the boat. This makes it hard to uncover a blocker's true concerns. Good managers will ask more straightforward questions like has the blocker had any negative interactions with us in the past? But he or she will also layer in questions that dig at potential underlying concerns like. How could this purchase make the blockers work more difficult? Finally, good sales managers will commit to a plan for managing the blocker. The goal here is to address the salespersons tendency to delay interactions with blockers. What is our strategy for dealing with the blocker prompts action from the sales team? OK, so how do you manage blockers? The first question sellers should ask themselves is can the blocker be persuaded by the supporters in the stakeholder group? In other words, can social pressure be applied to neutralize the blocker? Can they be influenced by mobilizers and other supporters within the stakeholder group? If the answer is yes, you want to apply social pressure through collective learning. As we discussed in this chapter, collective learning involves the exploration of objections, concerns and uncertainties among stakeholders surfacing disconnects, and competing viewpoints. Each of these actions is designed to get everyone on the same page, including the blocker. You're hoping to turn the blocker into a supporter, or at the very least mitigate or decrease their influence on the collective group. In addition to creating a collective learning interaction, these social pressures can be used to counteract a blocker. Conducting a workshop or other event where stakeholders can exchange views with the blocker. Identifying influencers that the blocker respects and having your mobilizer, broker and interaction. Arming your mobilizer or other influencers with information to convince the blocker to support the deal. Encouraging influencers to share why others are supporting the deal. In our research, we found that collective learning decreases likelihood of encountering a blocker by 20%. Further, there is a 35% increase in the likelihood of making a high quality sale when collective learning occurs within a stakeholder group that has a blocker. That's an extremely significant jump and underscores the importance of collective learning. The reason we try this tactic first is not only is it hugely effective, but also it's the lowest risk of all the tactics. Social pressure doesn't carry terribly high stakes. Sure, the blocker might get annoyed if colleagues want them to stand down, but that's about the worst outcome. What explains this impact? Engaging in collective learning creates a larger proportion of supporters in the stakeholder group, reducing the proportion of both neutrals and blockers, in turn reducing the impact of the remaining blockers. Blockers may still exist despite high collective learning. So if applying social pressure through collective learning does not turn or minimize the influence of the blocker, what do we do next? The second question that the seller should ask themselves is does the blocker seem reasonable and approachable? If yes, then the sellers should attempt to communicate through tailored dialogue to persuade the blocker to allow the deal to move forward. Note that we are not yet at the stage where we want to be making concessions. We will get to that in a moment. Different motivating factors drive different types of blocker behaviors. Some want to avoid change, some want the competition to win the business, and some simply want to see you lose the business. One of the blocker types, the Pro Status Quo Blocker, is best engaged by listening to and empathizing with their concerns regarding change. First, show that you understand their concerns, but also later reinforce the risks of not changing, creating urgency for the offering. You can also offer to connect them to previous or existing customers who had similar concerns. For the pro competitor blocker type, you should engage them in discussing the main motivation for making a purchase in general agnostic of supplier. Then explain how you can help them achieve their goals in a way that other suppliers cannot. For the anti supplier blocker type, you should engage by asking them to lay out their honest thoughts about you as a supplier, no matter how brutal. Acknowledge the truth in their perspective and share how you are committed to addressing and making up for your past mistakes. Take note that direct engagement tactics carry greater risk. The chances of the blocker taking a personal disliking towards you increase, and that's baggage no one wants to carry within a deal. But if social pressure failed to work, you may need to resort to this tactic. So what do you do if your blockers are not reasonable or approachable? Or if your efforts to communicate fall short? At this point, it's now time to think about making a concession. The third question that the sellers should ask as part of the progression is does the blocker have concerns about a specific aspect of the offering? If the answer is yes, consider making a targeted concession. Alter the deal to make it appealing, but not entirely commercially damaging to your organization. Now, concessions are tricky and by no means does this approach provide an exhaustive set of guidance for concessions or negotiation, but we can provide some general guidelines to follow when considering and developing concessions. First, thoroughly plan ahead and identify negotiable and non negotiable aspects of the deal. This knowledge is crucial for how you formulate your concession strategy. Second, take those negotiable aspects and hypothesize which aspects the blocker will react positively to and be more inclined to accept. Third, when developing the concession, you obviously want to concede as little as possible for your own benefit, but furthermore want to ensure that you do not endanger your support from other stakeholders because of a now watered down or no longer worthwhile solution. 4th To the earlier point, you need to get explicit support for this new vision of the deal from our set of supportive stakeholders. 5th Practicing good negotiating hygiene. Secure a guarantee from the blocker and other supporters that the deal will go through based on the new vision, preventing further concessions and further delays. You want to ensure that all the work that went in the concession leads to results, otherwise you have wasted time. And money. Again, you've stepped up the level of risk by altering the deal. It's possible that collateral damage is now done and chances are good that you've had to remove something versus making the deal bigger. Active trade-offs are now being made and that's definitely more risky for your commercial outcomes. If you get to the point where making a concession does not work, you then need to go to the final and last option. Escalate. The question you're sellers should ask themselves at this point is do senior leaders at the customer organization have an interest in this deal closing? If yes, you want to leverage someone more senior than the blocker to help grease the wheels and encourage the blocker to allow the deal to push forward. This is clearly the riskiest option and carries significant political ramifications for the blocker. It may potentially endanger their job or career path. Going over the top of the blocker and escalating is certainly a last resort type of option. To that end, let's take a look at some of the action steps and guidelines for the escalation strategy. First, contact one of the blockers leaders and explain the situation. But pick carefully. You'll want to pick a leader who you think can professionally manage the situation and would be receptive to escalation. Someone who can be trusted with mitigating the potential awkwardness of the situation. Second, ensure the leader understands the blockers motivations. Don't just approach them and say Johnny is not playing nice. You want to avoid making this an attack on the blocker. Provide the leader with a balanced perspective so they can judge and take action accordingly and professionally. Third, and this is contingent on steps one and two, if the blocker continues to stall the deal, you can ask the leader to overrule the blockers influence. Now this has the greatest potential for some scorched earth, and we would certainly view this as a last resort tactic. You obviously have to take into account the blockers influence for future deals and account growth. In parallel with all of those steps, it is paramount that you keep our supporters at the customer organization informed and in the loop to avoid concern around the deal, but also to continue the collective pressure that they might be able to exert on the blocker, either explicitly or implicitly. What happens if this strategy fails? At this point, you then have to seriously consider whether you want to actively pursue this opportunity any longer. Is it worth it? Does it still make business sense? That decision is going to depend on the nuances of your business and the type of deal. But in general, our view is that if a deal gets to this point, it's best to put it on the back burner, passively pursue and focus elsewhere. Just to recap, remember. Blockers cannot and should not be ignored. Their impact is immense and as we state here, blockers reduce the likelihood of making a high quality deal by 47%. Managers play a critical role. They can help lessen the likelihood of a blocker obstructing a deal by forcing sellers to identify blockers and conceive engagement strategies early on. You can minimize a blockers impact and influence, but you can't necessarily eliminate it altogether. Collective learning minimizes A blockers impact, but more aggressive engagement strategies may still be needed. The importance of collective learning can't be understated in today's consensus driven purchase, where divergent views and dysfunction reigns supreme and deals get compressed and compressed to the lowest common denominator. It's the means by which we can help our mobilizers forge a purchase decision. It brings diverse stakeholders, including blockers and procurement, together to make a meaningful decision. Implication #5. Sales Process and Opportunity Planning. Buying made easy. The challenges of today's customer purchase experience have been highlighted throughout this book. If there is one take away you should have from all the research and best practices shared to this point, it's this. Commercial organizations need to place far greater emphasis on supporting the customer's purchase process. One of our all time classic best practices comes from an organization that has done just that and shifted their entire sales process to more of a purchase enablement process. The company is ADP, the global payroll and human Capital Management firm, and this is their buying made easy purchase process. At first glance, ADP's approach might look a lot like your run-of-the-mill sales process. On closer examination, however, you'll realize this is very different. The first thing you'll notice is that ADP doesn't have a sales process at all. This is actually a very structured approach to moving deals through a customers buying process. This is precisely why ADP refers to this approach as buying Made Easy. This entire approach is designed to support the customer through a series of customer outcomes throughout a typical purchase experience. How most companies design A sales process, of course, is by mapping out the activities known to drive commercial success. Sellers are then expected to execute those activities as effectively and efficiently as possible. The idea being that if sellers do these things in this order, the chances of the customer purchasing are maximized. But what ADP is doing is different. From their perspective, the real question isn't how do we help our reps better sell, but rather how can our sales teams help our customer better buy. This process is predicated upon the major decision stages that nearly any customer will undergo, including one recognizing a need. This is where the customer initially determines a reason to explore a potential purchase, whether based upon an opportunity.\n",
      "Chapter One. The dark side of customer consensus.  This is a book of surprises. Chief among them is the surprising decline of historically effective selling strategies that now fail to generate anything near hoped for returns. Despite suppliers improved ability to convey their unique value, there's strong evidence that today's customers are less willing than ever before to actually pay for that value even when they perceive it. At least not when they believe the next, best, less expensive alternative is good enough to meet their needs. While today's suppliers may win the battle for awareness, consideration, recommendation and even preference, they still lose when it comes to what matters most. Getting paid. As exasperating as it seems, the very solutions most companies develop to escape commoditization have themselves become commoditized in the eyes of their customers. It all leaves commercial leaders wondering, what do we do now? What's left when the classic sales and marketing playbook we've relied on for so many years falls short? It was partly in response to these questions that CEB Sales and Marketing Practice conducted the research that led to the publication of the Challenger sale. An in-depth examination of the sales Rep behavior is most likely to succeed in today's commercial environment. But while the debate raged around us as to whether Challenger was right or wrong, new or old, too controversial or not controversial enough, we were focused on something else entirely. What else is there? In fact, the more research we did, the more insights we uncovered, and the more convinced we became that there was a second part to this story. One potentially more powerful than the first. It turns out the far bigger story isn't about suppliers struggle to sell solutions, It's the customers struggle to buy them. While there are many reasons customers fail to buy, our data shows clearly that the primary culprit is the dramatic increase in both number and diversity of customer stakeholders typically involved in solutions purchases today and more damning, the severe dysfunction that is bred by the ever expanding number of individuals who need to weigh in before a deal is signed. In the end, what has long seemed to salespeople like a well designed strategy to stick it to suppliers or beat them up on price is more often than not a function of a far less sinister but arguably infinitely more intractable problem. The inability of customers, stakeholders themselves, to achieve broad agreement on a common course of action in the first place. Much of the commoditization pressure suppliers face today isn't the result of customers willingness to settle for good enough. It's their failure to agree on anything more. And that's a challenge most sales and marketing strategies fail to solve, as it's a problem they were never designed to address in the first place. In fact, current sales and marketing tactics exacerbate this problem rather than overcome it. Of course, it's hard enough to sell effectively. How exactly are we supposed to help our customers to buy more effectively? Here, the research holds a final, delightful surprise. Just as we learned in our previous work that it is critical to have Challenger sellers, our latest work shows that it is equally, if not more, critical to have Challenger buyers. In a series of quantitative studies, we were able to isolate and study these individuals. These aren't your run-of-the-mill coaches or advocates doling out information to the sales Rep and vocally championing a given supplier with colleagues. These are a special breed of customer stakeholder focused much more on marshalling the internal resources and buy in necessary to compel their colleagues to collectively think and act beyond the status quo irrespective of supplier. As we've studied these individuals in a great deal of depth, what we've found is in a world of diverse and potentially dysfunctional customer stakeholders, it's not just that you challenge, but who you challenge that really matters. To win today, you need a challenger inside the customer organization. These customer challengers exist and can be found, but only if suppliers are looking for them in the first place. Because everything we've learned in all of our research clearly suggests that finding these individuals, winning them over, and then equipping them to win takes a completely different kind of commercial strategy than what's worked so well in the past. Who are these customer challengers? We call them mobilizers, and this is their story.  The problem of one of three. If there is one concern most top of mind among senior sales and marketing leaders around the world, it is the inexorable downward pressure on deal size, margins and growth as they navigate continued uncertain times. While their CEO's mandate a return to double digit growth. Commercial leaders find themselves more frequently than ever before, competing on little else but price. Perhaps most frustrating, however, is that traditionally proven strategy is designed to drive that growth No longer work nearly as well as they used to, leaving senior executives to assume they've somehow lost their way, broadly calling for a return back to basics as they exhort their teams to. Recommit to more disciplined execution. However, getting ever better at an approach already proven to fail does little more than demoralize everyone in the face of ever deepening underperformance. As the head of sales and marketing at a global industrial fragrances company recently put it. I just don't understand. We're the leading supplier in our industry. Our products are world class, our brands second to none, and our salespeople are highly skilled. There's not a single deal in our industry where we're not invited to participate. We make it to the table every single time. But even when we do, he went on, we're always one of three suppliers at the table. Despite all of our commercial strength, we end up competing on nothing but price every single time. It's killing our business. Our premium position simply can't sustain that kind of margin erosion. It's an incredibly common, but still maddeningly frustrating scenario. Here's a company that excels across every commercial metric that might matter, but still faces deep commoditization nonetheless. Welcome to what we've come to call the one of three problem, where a supplier commonly wins the battle for customer consideration, even preference, but ends up competing against two others on little but price nevertheless. How to respond? Typically, heads of sales and marketing would tell you if customers fail to fully pay us for all the incremental value we provide, then clearly they must not appreciate all the incremental value we provide. So they direct their teams to sharpen the company's value proposition. They equip reps to more crisply articulate the many ways in which their company can not only meet customers needs, but exceed them. Be carefully redesigned marketing campaigns and sales collateral to better communicate the broad range of their companies best in class, cutting edge solutions and unique ability to provide moments of deep customer delight. And yet in today's world, even when delivered well, most customers reaction to suppliers costly efforts to better articulate their company's value isn't so much wow, we had no idea, but rather something closer akin to yeah, we knew that already. Today's customers will often concede the point right up front. Responding. We totally agree. We think you guys are great, Your solution is by far the best and we'd love to partner with you. Which feels fantastic until they add. In fact, that's why you're one of the three companies we've invited to participate in this bidding process. But as much as we love your solution, this other company solution is good enough and they're a lot cheaper. So if we can get your solution at their price, then we're good to go. And that's painful. Despite suppliers best efforts to better convey their unique value, there is little evidence that today's customers are any more willing to pay for that value even when they perceive it. At least not when they believe the next best alternative to be sufficiently good enough. So a supplier wins in every way possible, raising awareness, consideration, preference, even recommendations, and still loses when it comes to what matters most. Getting paid. This is the core dilemma of selling solutions. Today most suppliers single biggest competitor isn't so much the competition's ability to sell as their own customers willingness to settle. Across the last five years, the CEB team has dug into this challenge with a huge amount of research into both sales and marketing capability and customer buying behavior, seeking to understand what suppliers can do differently going forward to avoid the underperformance of past approaches. What we've learned is fascinating, if not more than a little bit troubling. Much of the problem lies less in a supplier organizations inability to sell effectively and far more in a customer organizations inability to buy effectively. And a very large part of that challenge lies squarely in customers struggle to achieve common agreement across the wide range of stakeholders now typically involved in virtually any solutions purchase. The rise and fall of the 5.4. One might argue that the challenge of customer consensus is nothing new. Indeed, we've been hearing of the problem for years. And of course the economic downturn in 2009 did nothing but exacerbate the problem as increasingly cost conscious and risk averse decision makers balked at making even the smallest decisions on their own. And yet, if we Fast forward to today, the strange thing is while the global economy has significantly rebounded across virtually every metric that might matter, in that same time, the customer consensus challenge has become far worse. In a recent survey of senior sales leaders, we found nearly 80% reported the number of customer stakeholders involved in a typical deal continues to rise. Why? There are all sorts of reasons for the added number of individuals involved in a deal today, but chief among them would be. 1A Sustained and widespread aversion to risk among both individual customer stakeholders and organizations in the aftermath of the global economic crisis. Two, the fact that most solutions today have both a technological component and a higher price tag, necessitating not only the involvement of IT, but additional scrutiny by operations and procurements executives. 3A Greater concern among legal and compliance officers that all corporate initiatives meet tighter regulatory requirements and information protection protocols. Four, governmental regulatory reform, especially in health care, forcing industry wide shifts in how customers operate and buy. Five customers Efforts to expand operations globally, bringing new regional players to the table. Six, the simple fact that most solutions offered by suppliers today are purposefully designed to integrate more customer functions and tasks than ever before in order to provide customers higher impact, better value and improved ease of use. Seven new management styles and organizational structures leading to flatter, more networked organizations that place a premium on more frequent cross silo collaboration. Every one of these trends not only means more people involved in a typical purchase than ever before, but more important, more people across more roles who likely haven't been involved in the past. Of course, none of these trends is likely to reverse itself anytime soon. Bottom line, it's nearly impossible today to get a deal done without accounting for a seemingly vast array of budget owners, influencers and users. Third party consultants, you name it. But as the consensus story continues to evolve, the thing we find most troubling isn't the rise in number of people who have to buy in, but the equally dramatic increase in number of people who have to sign off. So unlike the consensus challenge of 2006, which largely centered around winning over a single senior decision maker and his or her team, today's consensus challenge has evolved into something far more complex. Today, whether suppliers are selling to a customer with 50 or 50,000 people, they rarely find that almost mythical senior decision maker able to individually approve a complex deal on behalf of all of their colleagues. Instead, more often than not, it's purchased by committee. It's collective consensus across a formal or informal group of senior employees, each with the ability to stop a deal if it fails to meet their particular needs or speak to their individual priorities. And that problem, we find, stretches well beyond just larger customers or more strategic accounts. Consensus challenges are just as likely to crop up in small and medium customers, where suppliers have traditionally been able to conduct most business through a single point of contact. As one sales leader in the food and beverage industry jokingly observed, even when we sell to mom and pops, we've got a mom and a pop, and they don't always see eye to eye. Small business isn't exempt from the consensus challenge. In fact, let's put some real numbers against this problem. In a survey of over 3000 stakeholders involved in a typical B2B purchase, we found that customers themselves report an average of 5.4 different people formally involved in a typical purchase decision. That's 5.4 opportunities for someone to say no. And that one simple number raises all sorts of questions for suppliers. Things like, do we even know who those 5.4 people are? For that matter, does our customer even know who those 5.4 people are? Sometimes they're not sure either. What does each of these individuals care about? How does our solution meet their individual needs? How do we win them over? The real trick in this new world of customer consensus is this isn't just 5.4 different people, it's 5.4 different perspectives. 3/4 of customer stakeholders we surveyed told us these 5.4 individuals span a wide variety of roles, teams, functions and geographies. And really this is the true challenge of consensus today. It's not so much that there are more people in a sale that makes things so hard. But that there are so many new perspectives. Every supplier has a version of this exact same story. For example, if you sell an IT solution, almost certainly you've traditionally called on the customers CIO and his or her team. But as most IT solutions today touch other parts of the business or more business decisions than ever before now feature a strong technological component. Now you're just as likely to also sell to CMO's, CEO's, or heads of HR, depending on who's using your system. Additionally, the broader scope and bigger footprint of your solution probably means you're also speaking with the CFO to procurement and maybe to regional presidents. Not to mention a whole range of end users, influencers, third party consultants and even potential partners. And lest we forget Legal, AKA the Sales Prevention Department. Indeed, one head of marketing in the healthcare industry recently told us for us it's not 5.4 people, but 5.4 committees of people. Bottom line, every supplier has their version of the same story, regardless of industry. We used to sell to X and now we sell to XYZ. As well as A, B and sometimes C. And everyone of them is different. Different priorities, different perspectives, different authority, even different levels of knowledge of what the supplier solution actually does in the first place and why that matters. That's the real challenge of customer consensus today. It isn't just a quantity problem. It's a diversity problem. Because when these groups come together to make a decision, almost inevitably it seems, things fall apart. The purchase likelihood drops dramatically as soon as a second decision maker is present. In a survey of 3000 customer stakeholders involved in a B2B purchase, we asked respondents the degree to which they agreed with the statement. We will definitely buy from this supplier in the next six months on a scale from 1:00 to 10:00. We tested other time horizons and got virtually the exact same result. Six months allowed us to capture the largest sample. We then map those responses according to total number of people on the buying team. Our data tells a dramatic story featuring two distinct downward inflection points. The first represents a rapid drop in purchase likelihood just by adding one more person to the purchase decision. So going from one to two people means overall likelihood to buy goes off a Cliff, dropping from 80% to the mid 50s. Indeed, apparently Mom and Pop don't always agree. Then things level off for a bit until we get past person #5. Then there's a second Cliff where likelihood to buy sinks like a stone to a dismal 30%. As a supplier selling to the 5.4, this is a hard graph to look at. From left to right, this is a one way ticket to indecision, with a final stop somewhere squarely in the center of what some sales leaders have come to call the solutions graveyard. From a research perspective, this finding proved hugely important, as it gave us the first indication in all our data that suppliers don't have nearly so much of A selling problem as perhaps they do a buying problem. Brought on largely by the new and wildly diverse cast of characters typically involved today in any Solutions purchase. For suppliers, however, that's a tough finding to digest as it's hard to know how to manage this kind of challenge. After all, customer diversity isn't something suppliers can make go away by telling their customer. Actually, we don't think your legal or procurement teams need to look this one over. For even if that attempt were to succeed in the short run, the long term consequences can be costly. As the chief sales officer at a global manufacturing company recently told us, we actually tried exactly that just last year, and it worked. We successfully cut everyone out of the purchase other than the head of operations and got the deal done in record time. The problem, he went on, was that when we then went to implement what we'd sold, all those people we'd previously caught out realized what was happening and completely overwhelmed the installation with objections and conflicts that we could have handled in advance if we just included them to begin with. In the end, he said, as hard as it may have been, we would have been far better off getting all those individuals on board as part of the purchase process because the bad will we generated as part of a rocky implementation not only undermine this deal, but likely cut us out of future deals for the foreseeable future. It's an incredibly tough thing to find out after it's too late to do anything about it. But it raises the questions If suppliers can't fully or even partially eliminate customer diversity as part of a sale, then how can they at least manage it more effectively? What's the best strategy for selling to increasingly diverse customer buying groups? Track them all down and win them all over. Around the world, the strategy for selling to diverse stakeholders follows the same frustrating reality. It requires a whole lot of work, and it requires a whole lot of time. In fact, most sales professionals agree the battle for customer consensus plays out across 2 dimensions, not just one. The first dimension is a challenge of access, simply winning the right to get in front of all the individuals who matter in the first place. And that's hard. With all those new people involved, the first step is figuring out who they all are in the first place. We encourage sellers to begin with the question, who are our 5.4 for this particular deal? It's a disarmingly simple question, but often surprisingly difficult to answer. In many cases, these aren't just new individuals, but new roles, functions, and maybe even geographies that that supplier has traditionally never called on before. And chances are pretty good that customers, stakeholders exact role in the purchase may be somewhat murky even to themselves. Beyond identifying them, however, is the more difficult task of winning. The right to speak with them, particularly as a seller may have little to no prior experience or existing connections to fall back on even in existing accounts with otherwise long standing relationships. What's worse, from the perspective of that target stakeholder, they may see no especially pressing need to talk to that supplier at all if they fail to see a relationship between their immediate concerns and the suppliers capabilities. Beyond winning access to each of these individuals, however, sellers still face the even greater challenge of winning each of them over ensuring they position their offering as precisely as possible so as to resonate with each stakeholders priorities and needs. And they have to do that 5.4 times, tracking them all down and then winning them all over. Now, one might argue, there's nothing new here. After all, that's nothing more than just plain good selling, same as it's been for years. But the real challenge is this is no longer a single sale, but a serial sale, each one a little different and carefully positioned to each stakeholder. To be sure, it is great selling, but it's great selling times 5.4. Checking off each stakeholder as they go, ensuring they've bought in before they move on to the next one. This one challenge has become the heart and soul of most sales managers checking calls with their team. So who have you called on so far? How did it go? Are they on board? How do you know? OK, who's next? How are you going to get in front of them? How are you going to position things for them? How do you think they'll react? What objections do you think they might have? Insert role play? OK, who's left after that? So reps work from the known to the less known, the familiar to the less familiar, slowly building consensus step by step as they seek to collect a yes from each of those conversations. A tenured sales manager we interviewed memorably compared it to the plate spinning act at the circus. You get the first plate spinning on the stick and then move on to the second. You get the second one spinning and move to the third, but somewhere along the line the first plate has started to wobble, so you have to go back and get it under control as you're simultaneously trying to move on to the 4th. And so it goes across the board, winning one stakeholder at a time. Check, check and check. But the deeper into the 5.4 we go, the harder these conversations become. In an all too common but still deeply painful scenario, the head of sales at a company that sells highly technical instruments for the manufacturing sector told us that his sales reps are almost exclusively trained engineers, which has always made sense in the past as they've traditionally called on engineers inside the customer organization. However, across the last five years, as the scope, impact and expense of their newer solutions have expanded, they can now rarely get a deal done without also speaking with the customer's head of finance. The problem is their reps have never sold to CFO's before and find them completely intimidating, so they avoid calling them altogether. But what do you do when your own Salesforce is literally too scared to call your customer? At first glance it might sound somewhat absurd, but this happens all over the world every single day. This is what happens when sellers move into the world of the 5.4. Sales reps familiar comfort zone of selling doesn't expand nearly as fast as customers required. Consensus zone for buying. Likewise, parallel efforts in marketing don't fare much better. A recent move in B2B marketing towards something known as B2P or business to people marketing arises in part from this exact same trend. There, the thinking goes, even in the world of business to business buying, it's not companies that buy things, but people that do. And with the rapid increase in both number and diversity of people involved in a typical purchase, suppliers have to understand those people today far better and get in front of them far earlier than ever before, with content and campaigns that will more specifically speak to each of their unique needs and priorities. In many ways, it's the marketing analog to the track them all down and win them all over sales strategy. So not surprisingly then, we've observed a strong and renewed interest among more advanced marketing teams in building ever more accurate customer personas, trying to understand individual buyers and their needs. Simultaneously, we've watched marketing organizations dedicate increasing amounts of time and money to building more targeted content designed to speak to very specific members of the 5.4 about the issues they care about most at each stage of the purchase journey. Given the scope of the challenge, however, these same teams, often made-up of only a handful of people, become easily overwhelmed trying to place highly personalized original content in all the right places at all the right times for all the right people involved in a typical purchase process. Even then, there is often little concrete evidence to show that any of this effort translates into real commercial outcomes, leaving marketers to point to intermediate measures like increased click through rates or more likes on the company Facebook page to justify the added time and expense of their effort. When we put it together, it's no wonder that commercial leaders around the world complain of increased cost of sale, longer cycle times, stall deals and smaller deal sizes. The ongoing battle of tracking down each of the 5.4 and then successfully winning each of them over not only takes a huge amount of time and effort, it's fraught with challenge every step of the way. And it leaves commercial leaders around the world thinking the same thing. As one head of sales and marketing put it to us rather poignantly, there's got to be a better way. All this customer consensus is killing our business. But what could that better answer be? In search of answers. Given this strong pressure on performance, the CEB sales and marketing practice recently set out to study the dynamics of customer consensus in far greater depth than we ever had in the past. At the center of this work was an effort to supplement the vast amount of customer research we'd already conducted in the past with new data aimed at group buying dynamics. And much of that data came from a survey of 1000 people all involved in some fashion in a typical B to B purchase, representing a wide range of both industries and geographies. More than anything else, the survey was designed to shed new light on the complex relationship across group buying behaviors, commercial outcomes, purchase attributes and sales Rep behavior. The story that arose from all that work is fascinating as upon first glance, it is deeply counterintuitive. In fact, when we first ran our analysis, we weren't sure whether we should believe the result. We went back and reran the numbers, remodeled the data, rechecked the sample in an effort to undo a finding that we initially found very difficult to believe. But the findings proved incredibly robust. Though those findings didn't seem to make a lot of sense when we first saw them, as we dug deeper into the data and continued to dissect the challenge it was meant to address, we came to the conclusion that we've been thinking about the consensus problem in exactly the wrong way, the implications for sales and marketing. We're huge. An unexpected finding? To show you what we mean, let's start with a concept we'll call a high quality sale, which serves as the backbone for much of our consensus work. The idea here is suppliers aren't looking to close just any business, they're looking to close good business. So while it is true that suppliers lose to status quo far more often than they'd like, it is equally true that even when they win, they often don't win the way they'd hoped. Perhaps the customer bought a much smaller, good enough version of their solution. Or maybe the customers so completely beat them up on price that the deal came in way below target margins? So technically we might call those deals wins, but they're hollow victories at best. We hear this all the time from commercial leaders. It's not so much the low quantity of deals they're doing that causes the real pain, but the low quality of the deals that are ultimately sold. So when we talk about a high quality sale in our data, what we're trying to capture is the kind of deal where customers buy the bigger solution at a higher margin. In our study, we defined a quality sale as a deal where customers number one did not settle for a less ambitious solution, but number two purchased a premium offering relative to the base offering. We tested for those attributes through a number of different questions across our various survey instruments. So now the question becomes, how does suppliers win that kind of high quality deal, especially in a 5.4 world? Well, let's go back to our strategy for selling to diversity in the first place and see what happens. You'll remember the conventional sales and marketing approach in the 5.4 world is we have to track them all down and then win them all over. When we ran the various commercial activities associated with that approach through our model, we found something rather shocking. When we measured each of those two approaches, IE winning access or tracking them all down and then better individual positioning or winning them all over against the probability of winning a high quality sale, we found that winning access to key stakeholders boosts that probability by a positive 4%. But positioning our offering to resonate more strongly with each stakeholder actually reduces that probability by 4%. Now, what do those numbers mean? Let's take them one at a time. The way to interpret the access number, for example is this. If we were to move from below average performance to above average performance on winning access to each stakeholder across the 5.4, we'd be 4% more likely to close a high quality deal. In other words, access matters. It has a statistically significant impact on driving up deal quality. Though you'd likely agree, it doesn't appear to matter nearly as much as anyone might have thought. After all, a 4% increase doesn't seem to be all that meaningful. That's kind of strange. But even stranger is our finding for Tactic #2. This is about winning over each stakeholder one at a time by connecting our offer as strongly as possible to whatever they care about the most. So we position our offer to meet their needs, emphasizing our ability to address their specific priorities, speak to their individual view of what's important, and connect directly to what they've got to get done, IE their MB, O's, personal projects, etc. And the impact here is actually negative. Now what does that mean? Well, what it means is that the better we get at customizing our offer at the individual level, the less likely we are to close a high quality deal. Effectively personalizing our offer to each stakeholder decreases deal quality, pushing us deeper into the very commodity trap we were hoping to avoid by personalizing in the first place. In fact, when we dig into the data one level deeper, we find that if we move from below average performance to above average performance on personalization, we're 20% more likely to have a negative impact on overall deal quality. In other words, the better one positions the offer to the individual, the more likely there is to be a negative impact on overall deal quality. It doesn't seem to make any sense. We can tell you our first reaction to these results was a whole lot of surprise mixed with more than just a little bit of concern. After all, we're the challenger guys, the group who found that the best reps are defined by their ability to teach, tailor, and take control. And yet this data seems to indicate that tailoring can actually hurt you. So we stared at this for a really long time, trying to figure out what was going on. But it wasn't until we saw the rest of the story, which we'll turn to next, that we figured out what's going on here. And when you see it, you'll find that this result makes a lot of sense. In fact, you'll likely be as surprised as we were that it wasn't more obvious all along. But before we go there, we first offer one crucial note to provide some important context to our earlier work. Rest assured, today is not the day we disavow ourselves of the Challenger findings and apologetically declare that we got it wrong the first time around. As you'll see, as we continue to work through all of our findings in the world of the 5.4, a challenger approach replete with effective tailoring is arguably more important than ever before. That said, at the same time, these findings have also led us to realize that we must be far more precise about what we mean by tailoring and how we go about it, in order not to inadvertently do damage where we sought to do good. For, the data is indeed very clear. Tailoring done the wrong way can have a significantly chilling effect on overall deal quality. Our traditional sales approach of gaining access and then making our pitch 5.4 times is insufficient to drive commercial growth. Yet that's exactly what most sales and marketing organizations are doing right now, all with the very best of intentions of pursuing a commercial strategy that, frankly, at first blush, seems inescapably logical. So what exactly is going on here? Well, remember, all of this research was conducted within a very specific context, not of selling behavior, but of buying behavior. Even more specifically, group buying behavior. Because what we're ultimately trying to figure out isn't how suppliers can sell effectively to individuals, but rather how they can sell more effectively to groups of individuals. And even more important, diverse groups of individuals. What we found is more than anything else, it's the diversity of these groups that makes all the difference. If there is one finding in all of our consensus work that stands above all others, it is that selling to individuals and selling to groups of diverse individuals is not the same thing. But not because the selling is different. Rather, because the buying is different. Solving for the right problem. You'll remember, the core tenet of marketers push toward B2P marketing, including more personalized content and messaging, is the broad recognition that at the end of the day, it's not companies that buy things, but people that do. And if we don't understand and connect to those people better than ever before, we'll fail to win them over. However, based on all of our research, what we've come to conclude is this. While it may be true that even in business settings it's not companies that buy things, but people that do, in today's B to B environment, it is equally true that it's not people that buy things, but groups of them that do. If we don't understand how these groups of people work together, if we sell only at the individual level and not simultaneously at the collective level, there's a good chance we'll miss what has become the most important dynamic in B to B selling today. Finding a way to connect the diverse individuals that comprise a buying group around a higher level vision than where they're most likely to land on their own. Why is that? There's a very good reason and it shows up right in the data. If we map the relationship between stakeholder diversity and something we've come to call stakeholder dysfunction, we find the relationship between the two to be very telling. Let's start with a couple of definitions. First, stakeholder diversity is based on the range of different functions, roles, teams, geographies, and divergent priorities represented across the various stakeholders directly involved in the purchase decision. Stakeholder dysfunction, on the other hand. Captures the degree to which members of that buying group struggle to effectively collaborate across a number of important dimensions. More specifically, for the purposes of this work, stakeholder dysfunction goes up when one's various stakeholders don't have a fair say in Group discussion. Two stakeholders avoid discussions of the most important issues regarding a purchase altogether. Three stakeholders outright disagree with one another multiple times regarding purchase details. These are all things that can be measured quantitatively by asking survey respondents a series of questions regarding how they collaborated with other members of the buying group. And really, this is pretty familiar stuff. If you think about a group purchase you've been involved in recently, you'll undoubtedly see some of your own experience in at least one or two of those attributes. Think for example about the most recent purchase of a new CRM solution in your organization and how that played out. So let's look at the relationship between these two things, diversity and dysfunction. The data is very clear. As stakeholder diversity increases, so does dysfunction. Pretty dramatically, in fact. Or put another way, as the diversity of the various stakeholders that suppliers find themselves selling to continues to expand, they can expect to see an equally dramatic rise in the dysfunction of the groups comprised of those increasingly diverse individuals. This all makes a ton of sense. There are all sorts of reasons why more diverse groups struggle to function effectively. If someone is working with a group of colleagues across their company, all representing different, sometimes even competing, perspectives and priorities, it's almost inevitable that they're going to disagree with at least someone. Not personally, but almost certainly professionally, as everyone is working toward whatever priorities make the most sense for their part of the business. In that environment, there are all sorts of reasons why individuals might fail to connect as that group deliberates. We all have a tendency to think very carefully about the cost benefit, trade-offs of different kinds and levels of group engagement. I don't want to share my opinion or advocate too strongly for my position. It's too hard. They won't get it. It's a lot of work for very little benefit. It's just not worth it. Or perhaps. I won't speak up because I don't wanna look dumb or selfish or too dominant or too weak or sound too much like I'm not a team player. On the other hand, other individuals might push too hard, seeking to win over the group by sheer force of will or rhetoric or even volume, failing to understand the very different perspectives around them. Achieving group consensus in an environment like that can be extremely difficult. Overtime everyone loses patience and maybe even gives up. Actually, when we think of it that way, it's a wonder that groups can agree on anything at all. That said, things don't necessarily have to be this way. When it comes to effectively creating customer consensus, the data provides a ray of hope as well. For just because diversity and dysfunction are highly correlated doesn't mean that they have to always be intertwined. In the end, suppliers may not have an uncontrollable diversity problem so much as they have an addressable dysfunction problem. Unlike customer diversity, which is largely out of suppliers control, customer dysfunction is something they can do something about, but probably not very well given conventional sales and marketing strategy. Because imagine how the track them all down and win them all over approach plays out in this world of high customer dysfunction. It does nothing to solve for the problem because this is a problem it was never designed to solve. Current sales and marketing tactics are designed to do something completely different. They are far more focused on better connecting individual customers, stakeholders to the supplier than they are on better connecting those same individual customer stakeholders to each other. To shed light on just how poorly suppliers Old World Commercial Approach is designed to solve for customers New World Buying dysfunction, let's take a closer look at what these buying groups are struggling to agree on in the first place. Because, as it turns out, the most common source of customer dysfunction has nothing to do with the supplier in the first place. Climbing the ME to We mountain. If we think about the various stages customer stakeholders must pass through to move a purchase forward at a high level we can narrow it down to three in particular, each crucially important. One problem definition. Two solution identification. 3 supplier selection. At any one of those points, things can go off the rails pretty badly as relevant customer stakeholders potentially fail to reach agreement. So as a hypothetical example, let's say a company has recognized they're unable to make effective strategic decisions due to their lack of quality data-driven insight. So what to do? Well, first that team has to reach agreement on what exactly the underlying problem is in the first place. Is a data quality data quantity. Data gathering. Analysis capabilities. Or maybe they have all the data they need, but it's trapped in various legacy systems that don't effectively communicate with one another. Whatever the case, that buying group has to first define the problem it's trying to solve. That said, once they've reached agreement on the problem, there's still the question of what to do about it. So let's say for example, they've settled on a data analysis problem. Now how to solve for better data analysis? Well, there are all sorts of approaches one might take there, ranging from something relatively straightforward like buying better analytical software, to giving staff the tools they need to study and play with the data in new ways, all the way to investing in training and development to give them the skills they need. To perform more sophisticated analysis. Of course, across that very broad spectrum of possible solutions, there are myriad other options, ranging from less expensive and disruptive to extremely so. Without agreement on a course of action, however, that deal isn't going anywhere. So for the sake of argument, let's say that that team has identified a solution that they can all agree on. Maybe it's the purchase of a new suite of analytical tools. The next step would be to shop that solution with various vendors in order to determine which one can best meet their needs and then eventually select the one that everyone can agree on. Now, admittedly, any given solutions purchase is far more complicated and far less linear than this. But it's an instructive abstraction nonetheless, as it allows us to measure the relative difficulty of each of these decision nodes across a typical purchase process. What we wanted to figure out in this analysis, in the unforgettable words of a senior manager at a business services company, was At what point across that continuum does the wailing and mashing of teeth reach a crescendo inside the customer company, exposing that deal to the greatest amount of potentially insurmountable customer dysfunction? Or put in a far less colorful way, when that purchase is most likely to fail. Now to figure that out, we asked respondents, as part of a much larger survey of 3000 customer stakeholders involved in a B2B purchase, to rate each of these three critical moments in terms of their relative difficulty, both with respect to reaching an individual or me decision. And in terms of achieving collective agreement or a wee decision? The first thing we find in our analysis is a much better understanding of just how much harder group decisions are than individual ones. Across the board, at each of those three decision points, the group decision, the wee moment proved dramatically harder than the individual decision, the Me moment. In fact, we can quantify the difference. On average, group decisions are nearly twice as hard as individual ones. If you think about any major purchase you've been a part of in your own organization, we'd imagine this finding will ring true. This is the price we pay for diverse buying groups. That said, the far more interesting output of this analysis is a clear indication that not all we moments are created equal. One in particular stands out as especially difficult, and that's solution identification. So while customers, stakeholders might all agree they have a problem, the data and common experience tells us there's likely going to be some pretty significant debate on the best way to solve that problem. This is a hugely valuable thing for us to know. Because it tells us that if suppliers are going to focus time and effort on creating customer consensus, the place where they really need to rally agreement is around the specific solution to the customers problem, irrespective of supplier. Now, by the same token, the analysis also tells us the thing least likely to create disagreement among stakeholders is supplier selection. Why is that? Largely because by the time the group has coalesced around a well defined high priority problem and an agreed upon clear course of action in many cases. From that point forward the biggest question left to address is simply which of any number of possible suppliers can deliver a well aligned solution. At a relatively reasonable price. Welcome back to the 103 problem. But if that's the case, then this data also tells us something about what most sellers and marketers are likely doing right now to win customer consensus, if they're doing anything at all. Because traditionally speaking, if there's one thing all suppliers are trying to get their customer stakeholders to agree on, it's that their company is great. That they're the best, that they're the leading provider of whatever solution that customer is already looking for. In most cases, that message sounds something like this. Our company is a leading customer focused global provider of innovative solutions supported by cutting edge innovations designed to empower organizations with different in kind sources of broad based value creation at their most critical moments of need. And oh, by the way, we're green. Sound familiar? If there was one thing we'd all want customers to agree on, surely that would be it. That we're the market leader, the leading brand, the best possible partner that we can not only meet their needs, but exceed them. So that's the thing all suppliers focus on. But what this data tells us is if that's the focus of suppliers consensus building efforts, then they're solving for only one of three possible consensus failure points across a purchase path. And of those three, they're almost exclusively focused on the least difficult for customers to agree upon. Not the most. At the same time, those same suppliers are leaving customers on their own to achieve agreement around the two points where things tend to fall apart. So if a purchase decision is going to stall, more likely than not, it's going to stall far earlier than most suppliers would anticipate. Particularly if they're focused only on watching for signs of customer disagreement around the value of their offering. As much as leaders tell us they want their reps to get in earlier, this data tells us pretty emphatically that if they do indeed manage to get in earlier, they need to take that opportunity to help customers overcome the challenge they're facing earlier. And that challenge has little to do with choosing A supplier and everything to do with deciding which problems are worth solving in the first place and what solutions are worth pursuing to solve them all, irrespective of supplier. This is why the Challenger approach proves so effective, as that's exactly what it's designed to do. To give you a sense of just how painful this kind of misalignment can be, the CMO at a medical equipment company told us the following story when he saw this data. Historically, his company has sold to surgeons who would debate the merits of their product versus those of the competition. It was a straight up battle over who had the superior capability. But today, when they call on those same hospitals, they find they're no longer sitting at the table with just the surgeon, but with a diverse group of buyers comprised of the chief surgeon, the CFO, the head of procurement and various hospital administrators. So now, instead of debating which suppliers medical equipment to buy, this incredibly diverse buying group is deliberating whether they should buy any more medical equipment at all, or take that money and build a new parking garage as an additional revenue stream for the hospital. This is what happens when diverse groups get together. Dysfunction almost naturally follows as not only perspectives but priorities become highly divergent. But more likely than not, it's not even dysfunction or disagreement around which supplier to select, but rather around which problem to address in the first place and how to address it. It's a painful story, but indicative of how misaligned most suppliers are today in helping customers overcome arguably the number one obstacle in buying their solution. Counterintuitively, suppliers biggest challenge in winning customer consensus has nothing to do with that suppliers solution at all. Even more troubling, much of the customer's primary consensus challenge occurs far before most sellers are even present to address it in the first place. Mind the gap from 37 to 57. In a well documented study, see The End of Solution Sales, Harvard Business Review, July to August 2012. The CEB team asked customer stakeholders to consider a typical B to be purchase process from beginning to end and then identify the point at which their organization typically reaches out to a supplier to seek their advice. That answer came back as 57%. On average, customers are 57% of the way through a typical purchase process prior to proactively reaching out to a supplier sales Rep for their direct input on whatever it is that they're doing. For suppliers evolving to complex solutions, our data also tells us that the more complex the deal, the later the customer contact. Why? Likely because customers looking to make large investments in a complex solution want to be extra sure they've done sufficient due diligence to avoid being unduly swayed by a particularly charismatic sales Rep accompanied by an especially knowledgeable sales technician bent on pedaling a general supplier solution. Rather than addressing a specific customer need. Now that 57% number has huge implications for suppliers. If we consider what's likely happening inside that 57%, chances are pretty good that customers are now doing on their own most of the things that suppliers were hoping to do with them together. They're identifying a need. They're prioritizing that need relative to others. They're determining which capabilities they'll require to address that need. They're identifying which suppliers are best able to deliver that capability. In most cases, they're conducting preliminary research on how much each of those suppliers cost. So by the time a supplier is called in at that 57% mark, more often than not there's little left to discuss but price. As one senior leader memorably put it. That 57% is a freight train to RFP station. And we're on it. Still more troubling, however, is what happens when we place that 57% number into the context of customer consensus. Because in follow-up research, we also ask customers to identify the point in a purchase process at which internal conflict most likely reaches a peak. Or the wailing and mashing of teeth hits a crescendo, and that deal is in the greatest danger of falling apart altogether. And that number came back as 37%. Group conflict peaks at 37%. That's the summit of the Me to We Mountain, where that deal is most likely to die. And you'll remember that peak centers around solution identification, not supplier selection. A problem most suppliers infrequently address. But let's consider what happens when we put these two numbers together. If a purchase decision is most likely to stall at 37%, but a supplier sales Rep isn't likely to be called in until 57%, then the resulting gap between the two raises a very practical and pretty troubling question. How many times have suppliers lost a deal that they never even knew was in play to begin with as the customer couldn't make it past the 37% mark on their own? Or more simply, how many times have sellers lost before they could ever attempt to win? The answer, of course, is unknowable, though deeply disquieting nonetheless. For in that gap, from 37% to 57% is a trail littered with deals that have been left to die. Among the dried up markers, leftover takeout food and haphazard piles of double sided PowerPoints strewn across the floor of customer conference rooms around the world. All bearing witness to the five point fours inability to reach collective agreement. That gap has hugely important implications for suppliers. Traditionally, most commercial organizations have considered customer consensus to be primarily a sales challenge, requiring reps to win broad customer agreement on the ground, one person at a time. But if suppliers are largely relying upon sales to stitch together collective consensus once they're called in, then the data tells us they're missing a crucial part of the problem. Customer consensus isn't a sales challenge, it is a commercial challenge. To be sure, there are a number of things sales reps can and must do to crack open the 57% and win earlier access to customer deliberations. But in many cases, if suppliers are doing nothing to simultaneously address the consensus problem earlier through marketing, then there's a good chance that that deal can die before sales ever wins Sufficient access to get a chance to even try. This challenge must be attacked from both directions simultaneously. For marketing, part, far beyond battling for individual residents through more personalized campaigns and content be to be marketers are going to have to find ways to anticipate customer disconnects far earlier in the purchase process and avert them proactively. For left unaddressed, these disconnects can be devastating to the suppliers bottom line. Fighting the lowest common denominator. When we put it all together, we find the far bigger challenge for suppliers isn't improving their own abilities to sell. It's addressing the customers inability to agree. To understand what's going on here, let's introduce a concept called a mental model. Now, we'll examine mental models in a significant amount of depth later. But for now, to keep things simple, think of a mental model simply as the way an individual understands their world and how it works. We represent these mental models with three overlapping circles in the form of a Venn diagram. So these might be three different individuals in different roles, functions or geographies. For each mental model, each stakeholder will have their own goals, priorities, means, and metrics, all unique to their particular perspective. This is the source of dysfunction. It's not these stakeholders different backgrounds per se, but the fact that those different backgrounds bring with them different, even divergent, mental models. Of course, if a supplier must target 5.4 stakeholders, that potential divergence becomes that much worse. It's a very simple concept, but that's on purpose because a simple concept like this allows us to visualize very clearly just what suppliers are up against in creating broad based customer consensus around a high quality deal. That's because the question we can now ask when looking at a diagram like this is. Just how much overlap is there across the different mental models of the various stakeholders that we have to connect? Really, that's the question that matters most, because that overlap is the single point of agreement across all those stakeholders mental models. It's where they connect. Where they agree. And if that overlap is very small, then that group can agree on only very little. So, left to their own devices, various stakeholders come together to consider a purchase. And if they find few shared priorities or little common ground for mutual understanding, they settle on the lowest common denominator where they're most likely to agree. Things like avoid risk, move cautiously, reduce disruption and save money. Every supplier knows all too well what it feels like to be on the receiving end of that kind of customer consensus. This is dysfunction. And this is what it gets us. It's not that diverse customer buying groups can't agree on anything. It's just that left to their own devices, they can't agree on very much and will rarely agree on anything that is highly disruptive or ambitious. If we think about what all of this means for suppliers, what this tells us is as they move into a world of increasing stakeholder diversity, suppliers are simultaneously moving into a world of increasing stakeholder dysfunction brought on by decreasing overlap in their mental models. As the little overlapping triangle at the center of that Venn diagram continues to shrink, it's no wonder that suppliers are all competing with status quo small deals and low margins. That's the one thing left in common among an otherwise divergent and dysfunctional group of diverse decision makers. This is the commodity trap suppliers struggle to escape every single day that sits at the core of the one of three problem. And otherwise dysfunctional group of customer stakeholders, unable to agree on a common vision but forced to agree on something, is likely to agree on doing nothing. Or at least doing as little as possible in order to find common ground. We can see this phenomenon in the data as well. A Dysfunctional group is a full 50% less likely to pay a premium for a high cost offering than a functional group. If we think back to where we started with suppliers, common approach for creating customer consensus and play it out in this world, we're now in a much better position to understand the findings we saw earlier. As we consider the Track them Down and Win Them Over approach, you'll remember we found that while winning Greater Stakeholder Access may help. More careful positioning of one's offering to each stakeholders needs actually hurts us, at least in terms of driving high quality deals. And that finding was really counterintuitive. But now, using a Venn diagram like the one we described, we can see exactly why that's the case. If we think about aligning our supplier value proposition more closely to each stakeholders mental model, insofar as those models are divergent to begin with, then they're making things worse, not better. They're exacerbating the very separation that keeps this group from agreeing on anything but the most basic common ground in the first place. At the end of the day, suppliers, traditional sales and marketing efforts have likely emphasized difference rather than overcome it. Underscoring individual separation rather than reinforcing mutual connection. What's fascinating about all this is that these findings shed light on one of the most frustrating phenomena in complex sales today. Watching a deal wither on the vine, despite the fact that a supplier has managed to successfully secure the support of each and every stakeholder who seems to matter most. We see it all the time. All the time. Marketing's personalized content brings in a lead the first person out of the 5.4. The sales team picks it up and engages that first person who expressed interest. And then proceeds to track down each and every member of the 5.4 until they have successfully won them all over. One by one. Everything seems to be in place. Then somehow, at the last minute, after every stakeholder has said yes. The deal inexplicably falls apart. Or at the very least, it shrunk down to a much smaller size at a far lower price than what was originally proposed. The seller is left wondering what in the world just happened. We had it in the palm of our hand and then it all just sort of slipped away. As one sales leader put it more often than I care to admit, we live in a world where each person says yes, but then the group ultimately says no. It's like I live in a world where 1 + 1 + 1. Equals 0. How is that even possible? Well, using the mental model construct, we can now understand exactly how that might be possible. There are a number of different versions of the same story, but one reason that deal may still fall apart is the fact that in winning over each stakeholder, the seller specifically highlighted those components or parts of their offering that spoke most directly to each individual's needs. And why wouldn't they? After all, they were likely trained to do exactly that. But think about how that approach plays out across a dysfunctional group. If the seller personalizes the offering so much, then when each of the 5.4 comes together to compare notes, they find that the proposed deal is far bigger, far more disruptive, and far more expensive than anything anyone individual thought they were signing up for. And then that group will naturally scope it back down to an acceptable size. If the supplier has done nothing to overcome their divergent mental models, helping them better appreciate the important connections across their otherwise disparate decision making criteria, then that deal is almost certainly destined for the dustbin, or at least some significant downsizing to something mutually agreeable to everyone. Bottom line, if suppliers don't create convergence, their customers will. If it turns out that the only thing those customers can agree on is to do nothing, then at the end of the day that's exactly what they're going to do. But notice that supplier lost not because they failed to connect individual stakeholders to them, but rather because they overlooked the fact that those same stakeholders weren't necessarily very well connected to each other. And that's how 1 + 1 + 1 = 0. The supplier collects a yes from each individual, but still gets a collective know from the customer. Because it turns out there's a vast difference between a collection of Yeses and a collective yes. So can suppliers get to a collective? Yes. Absolutely. That's what this book is all about. But building that bridge from me to we will take a very specific strategy targeted to a very special stakeholder. From Me to we. To show you what we mean, let's think of a typical customer purchase process as moving through three distinct phases. In phase one, we begin with the customer in a state of status quo. Then, through the recognition of some particular need, or perhaps through the exposure to an insight provided by a supplier, at least one or two of the stakeholders in that customer organization come to realize that change is necessary. Indeed it is in this first movement from phase one to phase two where demand is born as this is where high performing sales reps who we've dubbed challengers approach the customer armed with powerful insight to challenge the way they think about their Business Research that we've documented extensively in. The Challenger sale. Specifically, in this first movement, tailoring one's content and approach is crucial to win these individuals over in the first place. For done well, these stakeholders land in phase two, which is individual willingness to explore alternate course of action. The idea here is that someone inside the customer organization has recognized that they have a clear need worth addressing and they have committed to exploring it further. Of course, the degree to which the supplier has skewed that vision in their favor is critical. This is where we left things at the conclusion of the Challenger sale in phase two, with a number of customer stakeholders excited about a new idea and what it could mean for their company. However, despite the hard won individual buy in a supplier may have achieved in phase two, that potential purchase is still a long way off from an actual closed deal as that insight now has to traverse along second journey from phase two to phase three, which may or may not land in Group agreement around an actual purchase decision. It is across this second movement where individual support must somehow evolve into group consensus, moving from me to we as the supplier works with that stakeholder to build a bridge to the other 4.4. This can be a tough road to hoe because it is here that the supplier has to bring in the other stakeholders, get them to meet, convince them to agree and win them over. Procurements. Gotta get involved. Finance has to approve. Legal has to look things over. This is why the distance from phase two to three is so much longer than the distance from one to two. One member joked. This is where good deals go to die. It is indeed the Solutions graveyard. But it is also here where the sellers tailoring strategy must morph into something else entirely, tailoring for group consensus rather than tailoring for individual buy in. For if we think about the best way to build that bridge from me to we landing in a collective, yes, at some point in this process, the supplier will have to transition pretty sharply from connecting individual stakeholders to them and start connecting those same stakeholders to each other. Yet many of these deliberations and conversations are most likely to happen behind closed doors and over the horizon, well beyond the direct influence of an individual seller. So influencing these conversations can be incredibly difficult. Harder still, there's no indication in any of our research that individual stakeholders are created equal in their ability to influence those discussions when the seller can't be there to do it directly. Despite their common support for a particular course of action, in other words, not all customer stakeholders are equally able or even willing to fight the good fight of winning over the other 4.4 at the same time. Quite the contrary, in fact. This is where star sellers make a critical choice for, it turns out, the specific individual they seek out to help them build that collective yes, truly matters, arguably as much as any other decision they make in driving that deal. For without the right partner inside the customer organization, they'll likely fail to build a bridge from me to we able to sustain anything more than the most watered down of deals. So who do they choose? That's where we turn next. But lest you think you can skip the next chapter if you're in marketing, listen on, as the story you're about to hear will have hugely important implications for the entire commercial organization, both sales Rep skill and marketing capability.\n",
      "Chapter 3. The art of unteaching.  If there is one simple truth of every B to B supplier today, it is that they're all selling the same thing. Change. Whether it's convincing customers to buy from them instead of the competition to outsource to them what they've traditionally done on their own, or perhaps to upgrade to their newer, broader solution instead of maintaining their older, smaller one. One way or another, virtually every solution sale revolves around a suppliers attempt to convince customers to change. But think about what that means. What's the one thing most organizations would like to avoid at all costs unless they have absolutely no other choice? Change. Why? It's expensive. It's risky, it's disruptive, It's unknown. Indeed, the one thing all suppliers are selling is exactly the same thing most customers are actively avoiding. From that perspective, it's no wonder that solution selling is so hard. Or for that matter, that most suppliers single biggest competitor today isn't so much the competition, but the customer's own status quo. But if we consider the challenge of selling change within the context of creating customer consensus, we begin to see how monumentally difficult selling solutions truly has become. For as hard as it is to convince a single senior buyer that whatever they're currently doing isn't good enough, how in the world does a supplier successfully convince a diverse group of 5.4 stakeholders of the exact same thing? Especially when the end result will require some kind of organizational change that some if not all, would prefer to avoid if at all possible. Remember, if the 5.4 is naturally predisposed to agree on anything, more likely than not it's to avoid risk, move cautiously, reduce disruption, and save money. How is a supplier supposed to overcome that kind of broad based resistance to change? Mobilizing the mobilizer. When we think of it like this, it's no wonder that Star performing sales reps seek out mobilizers. After all, they're the individuals inside the customer organization most open to change in the first place. They're looking for new ideas, willing to consider alternate courses of action, and, crucially, able to win over others. Buy into that alternate point of view. That's not to say, of course, that mobilizers are necessarily looking for a supplier, or even less likely, a particular supplier. But they are at least grudgingly at times, willing to entertain a conversation with a supplier should they believe the supplier might have something worthwhile to share. Simply put, star performers, recognizing that they first and foremost sell change, very carefully target those individuals most open or least resistant to that change in the first place, and then lean on those individuals to drive that change elsewhere across the organization. One sales executive called it the New Physics of sales. Mobilizers, she told us, allow me to minimize inertia and maximize momentum. That said, if we think back to the three-step model of a customer purchase we introduced in Chapter one, those physics will play out in different ways at different points across the purchase process. From phase one to phase 2A, supplier must first convince someone inside the customer organization that change is even necessary. Remember, the goal isn't so much to convince someone to buy a solution, but rather to persuade them to change their behavior. Just because someone might be predisposed to favor change in general doesn't necessarily mean that they'll be willing to support the specific change advocated by a given supplier. So the way that Supplier's message is constructed, the way it's designed to make the case for change, really matters. As one head of sales told us. Look, I might be a mobilizer, but that doesn't mean I'm going to mobilize around every new idea put on the table. Context really matters. And he's right. Setting a mobilizer in motion across that first shift from phase one to phase two requires A convincing vision and credible evidence that that change is even worth it in the first place. Still, that's just the beginning. For, just because the mobilizer is open to change doesn't necessarily mean any of the other 4.4 are at all. That mobilizer now faces a real uphill battle building a bridge from me to we across the chasm from phase two to phase three. And the support suppliers provide in that effort can make all the difference in whether the mobilizer is both willing and able to successfully champion change across the rest of that buying group. Now, just to make things even harder, none of this happens in a vacuum. You'll remember CEB customer research has additionally found that customers are contacting supplier sales reps later than ever before across a typical purchase process. That's the 57% we reviewed earlier. Customers proactively seek out sales Rep input at 57% of the way through a purchase. That single statistic renders this entire three phase process significantly much more difficult. For just because sales reps aren't necessarily there to see it happen doesn't mean it doesn't have to happen nonetheless. Just the opposite. It means customers are now left to figure it out on their own. Now there are a number of things sellers can do to regain access to the earlier part of a purchase. We'll look at one idea in particular, social selling later. From a suppliers point of view, at the very least the 57% number tells us that much of the identification and motivation of a mobilizer may not happen through person to person sales interactions at all. But rather through broader based marketing channels designed to connect with customers far earlier. The lesson being, without tight integration between sales and marketing, it's unlikely A supplier can predictably influence any of this change process at all. But let's consider for a moment why customers are delaying contact with sales reps for as long as they are. The answer is simple, but rather instructive. Because they can. In fact, based on all of our research, we've come to postulate a sort of golden rule of customer supplier engagement. Left to their own devices, customers will always engage a supplier as late as they possibly can. In other words, much of the reason why a customer engages A supplier 57% of the way through the purchase rather than earlier, is that they don't believe that the supplier has anything valuable to contribute to the conversation. At least nothing. They couldn't get off that suppliers website on their own without having to speak with a sales Rep. So if I reach out to a supplier, the thinking goes all they're going to do is drone on about their product or service and ask me lots of open-ended questions that I don't need their help answering. It's biased information, and it's never really about helping my business so much as selling theirs. Who wants to sit through that? In a world of information accessibility, customers can get all of that on the Internet. Talking directly to a supplier feels like a waste of time. Let's face it, many of us listening to this book sell for a living, and we likely feel exactly the same way about people who sell to us. Why talk to a salesperson unless you really think you have to? That's exactly where teaching comes in, convincingly proving to customers and especially mobilizers that they do have to talk to you. But now we can better appreciate the very specific and rather complicated context within which we must deploy that teaching. In this world, suppliers teaching must one capture the attention of a mobilizer in a way that two motivates them to champion a change in behavior, leading them to three rally the support of the other 4.4 around a vision that four. Leads that customer back to their unique solution. That's a very high bar indeed. In fact, we have a name for this very special kind of content. We call it Commercial Insight. The reason we find commercial insights so powerful is that it's the only kind of teaching we've found in all of our research that can impact customer buying behavior across all three stages of that buying process, irrespective of where it's deployed. Whether it's winning, the willingness of individual stakeholders to mobilize in the first place, or equipping those mobilizers to win over the other 4.4 who are potentially even less inclined to change. That's because Commercial insight is designed to change what customers are currently thinking, regardless of what that thinking might be, whether it's to do something different or just as likely to do nothing at all. In a world where every supplier is selling change, producing content with that kind of impact really matters. But for Commercial Insight to have that kind of broad influence across the customer purchase, it must follow a precise set of design principles, for only a small fraction of the content most suppliers produced today is designed to drive that kind of behavior change. Chief among those designed principles is the idea that effective commercial insight isn't designed to teach so much as to unteach. Not teaching, but unteaching. Naturally, in order to capture customer attention, supplier content must have something valuable to say. But what exactly must it say in order to drive customer behavior change? What kind of content can do that? To figure that out, our team at CEB conducted a large scale survey of several 100 customer stakeholders all involved in A, B to B purchase across every major industry geography and go to market model. More precisely, we wanted to identify with data the kinds of content attributes that have a meaningful impact on customers current thinking. Whether that be the status quo or a particular course of action. In other words, the question we set out to answer was what kinds of supplier content can bend the path across the customer's ME to WE mountain? Now, to figure that out, one can't simply ask customers what will blow your mind. Because they likely won't know, and if they do, they probably wouldn't admit to it. So instead, we first asked customers to consider a recent purchase of a more complex solution, and then report the degree to which their direction across that purchase process changed on a scale from one to seven. Separately, we then asked respondents to score the value they place on various aspects of the content they typically consume as part of any purchase process. Anything from readability to relevance to data quality to credibility. When combined, those two sets of questions allowed us to statistically derive the potential impact of each of those inputs on actually changing customers purchase direction. And the result was fascinating. Before we turn to what does matter, it's instructive to look at what doesn't. Four. Of all the content attributes we tested, only two turned out to be statistically significant. Everything else had no statistically meaningful impact on changing our customer's purchase direction at all. So for example, the fact that content is easily accessible and quick to find has no bearing on customers likelihood to change their thinking. Nor does the degree to which content contains interesting facts or anecdotes, or whether it's easy to understand. Now, in many ways that makes a lot of sense. It seems unlikely that a customer would change course simply because a particular piece of content was easy to find and particularly well written. But one attribute that also doesn't matter was far more surprising. Among these statistically non significant drivers of changing customer buying direction was content representing a smart or expert perspective. For many suppliers, that finding is far more interesting, as that attribute reflects the stated strategy of most B to B marketers around the world. In a world awash in content of low quality and little relevance, many marketers would argue that the best way to stand out is through high quality content, representing a smart, distinctive perspective that clearly positions that supplier as a thought leader in their industry. The belief being that thought leadership is crucial to a supplier's ability to differentiate not only their content but also their capabilities. Surely, the thinking goes, a company that produces high quality thought leadership must also offer high quality solutions. It engenders trust. It conveys credibility. It tells customers we know things about the world and you should talk to us before you make a decision. In fact, across the last five years, bolstered by the rise of content marketing and new marketing automation technology, marketers have invested an enormous amount of time, money and resources into thought leadership for exactly these reasons. Indeed, many CMO's have told us it's their stated strategy for standing out in a crowded marketplace where they might otherwise become easily commoditized. But if that's the case, this data is rather troubling, as that strategy has no statistically measurable impact on changing actual customer buying behavior. Particularly in a world where suppliers compete with customer status quo as often as anything else, that's a worrying finding to say the least. So what does have a statistically significant impact on changing our customers purchase direction? In our analysis, we found only two drivers capable of reliably driving that kind of change. 1. Teaching the customers something new and compelling about their business and to providing customers with a compelling reason to take action. In other words, customers are most likely to rethink their current course or reset pre established buying criteria only when confronted with surprising information, not about the world in general, but about their own business. More specifically, information laying out not just the benefits of taking action. But the costs of inaction? It's this kind of content we've come to label insight. We'll get to the commercial part in just a bit. Regardless of whether it's delivered through a sales Rep conversation or some other content, Channel Insight is designed to demonstrate to customers that despite their own learning and their own expertise, they've missed something materially important to the performance of their business. A new way to make money, save money, mitigate risk, or penetrate new markets. All based on information that they themselves would not have discovered on their own. Insight, in other words, isn't designed just to teach customers something new that they've never thought before. But to unteach them something that they already have. Now we've been talking about Insight for a while now, as the concept has played a central role in our challenger work from the very beginning. While we've been careful to define the term as precisely as possible along the way, in working with companies all over the world, we've learned that as careful as we've been to define what insight is, we need to be equally careful to define what insight is not. Insight is not thought leadership. When it comes to insight, we find the term suffers from a strong false positive problem. As much of what passes under the name of Insight to Day falls into the much broader and arguably much less valuable category of thought leadership. So let's see if we can put some clear boundaries around what we mean by insight. If we think of all the different kinds of content a supplier might produce in the name of insight, we find there are a number of different layers to that content, each separated by a boundary delineating that layer from the next. Let's start with general information. General information is, well, just that information. That covers generally just about everything. It's that overwhelming flood of information out there that customers spend more time filtering out than taking in. So clearly the first hurdle suppliers need to overcome in building insight is to be heard in the first place to capture the customer's attention. So a supplier's first hurdle in content creation is ensuring that whatever they produce in the name of insight is credible and relevant. If customers don't believe what a supplier is saying, or don't believe it applies to them, that suppliers Insight isn't going to get a lot of attention. Of course, the bar for credibility may present a moving target in some cases, as what we call the burden of proof of a suppliers insight will largely determine how credible the information upon which that insight is based must be. The more counterintuitive or surprising the finding, the higher the burden of proof and therefore the more robust the evidence must be. But let's say the information a supplier publishes passes that first Test. It's both credible and relevant to the customer. That's fantastic. But it's still not insight. In fact, at this point, we've landed at only what we might call accepted information. What is that? Accepted information is credible, It's relevant, but frankly it's just not all that interesting. It sounds more or less like everyone elses information. Often taking the form of factoids or data points. There are a huge number of companies out there every day producing mountains of data, all in the name of insight that frankly represents nothing more than accepted information. Some examples. 90% of CIO's are concerned about what cloud computing means for their organization. 75% of CEO cite sustainability as a priority but admit they don't know how to achieve it. 80% of global workers report feeling disconnected from their work. These are all interesting, relevant, credible statistics. But still, they are statistics. They're not insight. Insight and data are not the same thing. More to the point, this data doesn't tell anyone anything new. Sure, we may not have known that it was 90% of CIO's who are worried about what cloud computing means for their organization, but we could have easily guessed it was a lot of them. That's the defining characteristic of accepted information. It doesn't tell someone something they didn't know. Rather, it largely confirms or validates something they already did. So customers won't necessarily ignore the information. They view it, read it, maybe download it, perhaps like it, and possibly even agree with it. But they probably won't do anything about it either. At least nothing they weren't going to do already. And yet, it's stunning the amount of content and collateral that's built on this type of information, all in the name of insight. So what's next? Let's move a step deeper across a boundary we'll call newsworthy. Clearly, if we want someone to act differently, we have to first get them to think differently. To do that, we're going to have to show them something truly newsworthy, and that brings us into the third layer of information. Thought leadership. Interestingly, above all other categories of content we've laid out so far, thought leadership is the one that can really get a supplier in trouble. Not only because this is the kind of content most suppliers are creating, but because it's the one most suppliers aspire to create. Virtually every marketer will tell you their company strives to be a thought leader in their industry. So what is thought leadership? It's interesting, newsworthy, incremental information that customers themselves likely could not have discovered on their own. So unlike accepted information, thought leadership is additive. It provides new perspectives or new data that teaches and doesn't just confirm. So to be fair, for the first time across our inventory of content, there really is some teaching happening at this third level. And that's great, for what it's worth. But the real limitation of traditional thought leadership is that it doesn't necessarily drive action. Readers learn, but they don't necessarily do. People may be liking or retweeting the content. But it isn't moving them to action. That's because most thought leadership is largely focused on presenting a new idea rather than undermining an existing one. So while thought leadership attracts a lot of attention, it typically has little lasting impact. We all think, wow, that's really interesting, and then we go back to whatever we were doing before. So it fails to have much commercial impact as it provides only a very weak means at best for driving customer behavior change. So what else is there? Well the next filter is be frame breaking. This is the final bar we need to clear for our content to truly be called Insight. But why that filter frame breaking? What we find is that insight is something else entirely. It's designed to upend the status quo. As such, insight isn't about one thing, It's about two things. It doesn't just convey an idea of what the customer could be doing, like thought leadership, but also conveys a story around what the customer is currently doing, explicitly laying out why that current behavior is costing the customer time. Or money in ways they never realized. That's the key. The contrast. It's the cost of current behavior juxtaposed to the potential of alternate action. Implicit in any good insight is the simple message, Hey, you're doing it wrong. And done well. It causes your customer to say I have to change what I'm doing. Thus the term frame breaking. That's a totally different outcome than one achieves from all of the traditional thought leadership that so many aspire to produce. Insight is a powerful tool to shape or reshape customer demand because it's designed to cause cognitive and emotional dissonance between current behavior and an alternate action. Customers reaction to well designed thought leadership is wow, they're smart. Customers reaction to well designed insight is. Wow, I'm wrong. Of course, as we've said all along the way, one delivers That message really matters. To be effective and not offensive, insight must be delivered professionally, diplomatically, empathetically and culturally correctly. It's about creating constructive tension, not just tension. Otherwise, it's not so much insight as just a plain insult. Still, when the CEB team is working with member companies on the insights they produce, the first thing we'll typically ask when a company shares an insight for feedback is. Show me the page, show me the data, point the bar graph the bullet point, the moment where you looked your customer in the eye, and tell them that they're wrong. If you can't find that moment in your content, no matter how diplomatically formulated, chances are pretty good you haven't created insight at all. As the commercial team at CDK Global, formerly ADP Dealer Services, likes to say. We have to teach our customers that the pain of saying is greater than the pain of change. Now, that said, we're still not done. We still have to ensure one gets paid for all of this work. So how does that work? Getting paid for insight. It's one thing to drive customers to do something different, but another thing entirely to ensure they do it with you. So imagine a scenario where a supplier teaches their customers something new. The customer then takes that insight, puts it out to bid and the suppliers direct competitor wins the business. That doesn't feel so good. And we'd agree. In fact, we call that free consulting. Few suppliers ever sustainably grew their business falling into that particular trap. So in order to ensure a supplier gets paid for all that insight, we still must pass through one last filter. That supplier must ensure that whatever they teach the customer about the customer's business actually leads back to some capability that that supplier is able to provide better than anyone else. Thus the term commercial insight or what we've called elsewhere, commercial teaching. It's insight that meets the frame breaking bar, but simultaneously leads the customer back to that particular supplier as the only one able to help them take action on that insight. So when the customer says wow, I gotta do something about this. Who can help me make this happen? That supplier must be able to legitimately look them in the eye and say let me show you how we are the only supplier who can help make that happen. Much of our work of late has been focused on helping members identify that set of unique benefits in their organization to serve as the foundation for this type of commercial insight. For, it turns out this is not an easy question to answer. In fact, it's not one question but three that a supplier must answer to do this well. The first is simply. One What are we good at? Hopefully that's a question the answer to which can fill a couple of pages as it refers not only to the features and benefits of the solutions of supplier cells, but to all the capabilities that surround that solution as well supply chain capabilities, financing opportunities, data-driven market perspectives. Whatever the case may be. Think broadly. The second question, however, is much harder. 2. What are we uniquely good At? This is where the pain kicks in, as most companies can successfully answer question one but struggle mightily with question 2. One head of sales at a food ingredients company once memorably asked us. In one part of our business, we sell salt. It's not fancy salt, it's not gourmet salt, it's not sea salt. It's just plain salt, Mountains of it. And our salt isn't any different from any one else's salt. What's the unique strength in that? Our answer was quite simple. We have no idea. Be that as it may, however, chances are pretty good that that supplier does indeed have some sort of unique strength somewhere in its salt business. But chances are equally good that that strength does not lie in the salt itself. In fact, that's almost definitionally the case. Instead, the unique strength of that business likely lies elsewhere in all the various capabilities that that company brings to bear to deliver that salt to market. Maybe it's something about where they mind the salt, creating shorter supply lines, thus enabling just in time delivery and reducing customers carrying costs. Perhaps it's their ability to mine salt around the world, allowing for an uninterrupted supply despite changing geopolitical and climatic conditions. Perhaps it's their uniquely strong financial arm which enables customers to buy certain financial instruments, allowing them to hedge against risk from fluctuating salt prices. Granted, these are all strengths we've made-up based on pure guesswork, but they're meant to be indicative of the wide net companies must cast when seeking to define their unique strengths. Should they focus too narrowly on their products and services alone, chances are pretty good they may overlook a number of potentially powerful differentiators. The third and final question. It's about time. 3. Which of our unique capabilities is sustainable? After all, an easily copied unique strength isn't much of A unique strength at all. So to sum it all up, what makes something a true differentiator? At its most basic level, a true differentiator is unique, valuable, defensible, and sustainable. It's a pretty straightforward list. But consider for a moment what that list rules out. Differentiators are not one features and benefits common in a suppliers market. Two outcomes the suppliers product generates or. 3. Vague descriptions or overused descriptions that include any of the following words. Innovative, green, user friendly, or solution. In many companies, we find that once one controls for those three things, there is virtually nothing left. In fact, in a recent CMO survey, we found only 1/5 of marketers could claim with confidence that their differentiator articulated a true difference in kind from the competition. IE we're different rather than a difference in degree. IE we're better. No, seriously, we're better. Not surprisingly then, only 13% felt they could pass what we consider to be the ultimate differentiator test. If we took all the names and logos off of your commercial content and gave it to a competitor to present to a customer, would that customer still necessarily have to buy from you? When you can say yes to that question, you've got something powerfully different to hang your commercial insight on. Winning as an organization, not as an individual. Notice how these aren't questions any commercial organization would want to leave up to their sales reps to figure out on their own. Indeed, we've watched a number of companies around the world do exactly that, often following the guidance of sales training vendors, leading almost inevitably to highly limited and potentially dangerous results. Simply putting sales reps through some kind of bootstrapped insight generation training with the assumption that building commercial insight is essentially a skill to be taught, similar to negotiation or presentation techniques, almost inescapably leads to weak insight. Building effective sustainable commercial insight requires a much broader organizational capability, if for no other reason than this stuff can be really hard. It takes multiple sources of information. It demands a deep understanding of a company's strategic direction. It requires access to customers well beyond just individual sales conversations. But most important, it requires broad, consistent application across a suppliers vast array of sales, service and marketing communications. All that is going to take time, patience, multiple iterations and consistent focused senior executive buy in to really work. What we're talking about here, in other words, is a fundamental review of how a company goes to market. While that question undoubtedly requires frontline input, it is nonetheless an inquiry best guided from the most senior ranks of an organization up to and including the CEO. Commercial insight isn't an individual sales technique nearly as much as organizational commercial strategy. The front end of that effort undoubtedly requires a very different way of thinking about customers. A very different kind of customer understanding. The last ten years have seen an explosion of interest in customer understanding, led in particular by marketing organizations seeking to ensure their company not only meets customer expectations, but exceeds them. Not surprisingly then, marketers have invested huge amounts of time, effort and money developing a wide-ranging toolbox to determine whether their organization is delivering a world class customer experience designed to offer memorable moments of delight across every possible customer touchpoint. While this work can span a wide range of activity, anything from interviews to focus groups to infield ethnographic research, much of it relies heavily on the most tried and true of marketing tools, the customer survey. Though, to be sure, those surveys have evolved significantly over time. From customer satisfaction to customer loyalty to voice of the customer to Net Promoter Score to customer experience. Indeed, commercial organizations around the world pour over the results of these surveys on a regular basis, often making large scale strategic decisions and allocating large amounts of company resources based solely on the information they contain. Yet as useful as those surveys are in retrospectively gauging company performance, it turns out they're virtually useless for proactively building world class commercial insight. Why? Because every one of those surveys is designed to test for the exact same thing. Customers perceptions of the supplier. Do you like us? Are you satisfied with us? Will you remain loyal to us? Are you willing to recommend us? Granted, those are all important things to know, but notice that they're all supplier focused. Each one provides an ever more accurate snapshot of how the customer views the supplier. But you'll remember, the key to commercial insight isn't a story about the supplier at all. It's a story about the customer and how they've missed something materially important to the performance of their business. As a result, in order to build world class commercial insight, suppliers don't necessarily need an ever more refined view of how customers perceive them. What they need is a significantly more refined view of how customers perceive themselves. Surprisingly, very little effort in the name of customer understanding today is designed to figure that out. In fact, a disturbingly large number of very senior marketers have told us they lack any real sense of how their customers view themselves. Some have even told us that they rarely, if ever, talk to their customers at all. But it turns out that kind of customer understanding is absolutely crucial for commercial insight to work. Because the only way to diplomatically tell a customer that they're wrong is to first understand what they believe in the first place. That set of beliefs is something we like to call a mental model. Building and breaking mental models. As we saw earlier, selling solutions is all about getting customers to change. Whether it's getting customers to move from buying nothing to buying something from buying from a competitor to buying from them, or from buying something from them to buying even more from them. Commercial teams primary mission is to move customers off of their current behavior and toward a new desired behavior. However, in a world where both individual customers, stakeholders, and entire customer organizations can learn on their own prior to ever engaging A supplier, the biggest challenge is getting customers to reconsider their current thinking in the first place, irrespective of whether that thinking entails criteria for a particular. Kind of purchase, or just as likely, a strong belief that the current status quo is already good enough. You'll remember this challenge presents at 2 levels or across two different movements. First we have to get a proto mobilizer to reconsider their individual thinking. Then we have to get the entire 5.4 to reconsider their collective thinking. But how do we do that? How do we get them to believe that change is not only possible but desirable? That undergoing the pain and disruption of shifting from their current behavior where they are now, to our desired behavior where they are more likely to purchase our solution is worth it in the first place. Well, the most common way is to paint the most attractive picture possible of how wonderful the world of the new behavior could be, if only the customer would just embrace it. So suppliers invest heavily in extolling the benefits of a world supported by their solution. They develop all sorts of data touting the benefits of the new behavior. They develop ROI calculators, showing customers how much money they can save by making the shift. They paint a broad, compelling picture of the unquestionable quality, cutting edge technology, proven reliability, and unlocked hidden value realized only by embracing that new direction. And they provide customer testimonials reflecting how wonderful life in that new world can be. And yet, suppliers are surprised and disappointed when, despite their best efforts, customers failed to respond favorably, ultimately choosing to remain steadfastly on course. Whatever they were doing already. They're left scratching their heads, wondering where did we go wrong? Do we need a different ROI calculator? Do we need better customer testimonials? Perhaps we should redesign our website. We need an urgency driver or what we really need is a sharper value proposition. The amount of soul searching, finger pointing, and second guessing that goes on at this point is enough to undermine even the very best of collaborative organizational cultures. But why is this such a struggle? Why is it so hard to redirect customer buying behavior? Well, what most suppliers fail to fully appreciate is that current behavior is significantly more entrenched than they might realize. Not simply because of some kind of broad organizational inertia or failure to appreciate the superiority of their solution. But rather due to an underlying set of beliefs and assumptions about how the world works. Psychologists call this a mental model. Our customers mental model dictates virtually everything that they do. That mental model doesn't just matter, it matters a lot. Because that's what's driving that customer's behavior in the first place. If you want to change behavior, you first have to change the mental model. It's the frame in the frame breaking we need to do to really call it insight. Put another way, the only way to change how a customer acts is to first change the way that that customer thinks. You'll remember from Chapter one the degree to which the mental models of each of the 5.4 are highly divergent. That it's not just one way of thinking we have to change, but potentially many more. Be that as it may, what we've consistently found in all of our research is that the best sales reps, challenger reps and the best companies, challenger organizations seek customers current mental models as the primary leverage point for driving customer behavior change. So rather than engaging customers in a debate on the merits of the suppliers proposed solution, the best suppliers engage their customers in a discussion of the customer's current beliefs. And in that discussion they diplomatically, empathetically, culturally, correctly, yet systematically break down their customers current mental model, show them how it's flawed or incomplete, and then articulate in very clear terms why a move the customer assumes would be too costly or too painful. Is actually less costly or painful than their current status quo. It's a careful, credible demonstration that the customer's current mental model is not only flawed, but costing them money or exposing them to risk in ways they never fully realized. That indeed, the pain of seeing is greater than the pain of change. This is the true power of commercial insight when it's done well. Not only does it paint a picture of how great life could be if they change, but far more important, it teaches customers that it's not nearly as good as they think it is, where they just stay the same. At the same time, this is what virtually every supplier is currently missing in their current content creation efforts. A disciplined, systematic approach to understanding and then replacing a customer's mental models. Bottom line, the only way to get customers to think differently about you is to first get them to think differently about themselves. This is why efforts to understand how customers perceive themselves in the first place are so important. Without that very different kind of customer understanding, a supplier can't build the mental model in the first place. And without that mental model, a supplier can't effectively overturn a customer's current thinking. One can't change the way a customer thinks of themselves if they don't even know how that customer thinks of themselves in the first place. So what exactly is a mental model and how would one build 1? We'll cover that with some very concrete practical examples in Chapter 5. But for now, let's sum up everything we've learned about commercial insight in a single, simple but powerful explanation. Breakdown the A, then build up the B. To simplify what admittedly at first glance must feel like a relatively complex idea, let's boil this down to two simple things. The customer is current beliefs and behavior on the one hand, and their desired beliefs and behaviors on the other. Here desired refers to what a supplier essentially hopes a customer will believe and do, as that behavior will most likely lead directly to the adoption of that suppliers solution. Imagine a diagram with a large A on the left connected by an arrow to a large B on the right. We like this model because it allows us to ask a very simple but rather telling question. If you were to consider all of the collateral, all of the pitch decks, all of the content your organization currently creates in an attempt to get customers to buy your solution, what's it mostly about? Is it primarily about the a current beliefs slash behavior or is it largely about the be desired beliefs slash behavior? For most organizations, the predominant answer is by far the bee. For reasons we just discussed, suppliers bend over backward extolling the virtues of the bee. Painting as attractive a picture as possible of life over there on the right, in a world supported by their solution. So they walk through its utility, calculate its return, demonstrate its value, and enumerate its benefits. All in an attempt to convince customers, through sheer force of persuasion that whatever they're doing over on the left couldn't possibly be as good as what the suppliers suggest they could be doing over on the right. By and large, it is a battle for the bee. But the strange thing is, more often than not, suppliers will win that battle but still lose the war. Customers will look them in the eye, emphatically agree that B is indeed better, but still not budge off their current behavior. When that happens, suppliers natural inclination is to conclude that their articulation of the bee must need further refinement. For clearly if it were more compelling than that customer would make that move. But all that added effort rarely returns additional benefit. As one senior leader memorably told us, if our value proposition got any crisper, we'd have to write it on a cracker. But it's still not enough. After studying this problem for the better part of five years, we've come to conclude the real challenge in changing customer buying behavior isn't a better articulation of the benefits of B. It's a better articulation of the pain of a. Without that, the bee may seem great, but the A still remains good enough. Winning a solution sale, in other words, isn't so much a battle for the B nearly so much as a battle for the A. Or, as we like to say, you have to break down the A before you build up the B. Again, that's the moment where you must tell the customer, diplomatically, empathetically and culturally correctly, that they're wrong. Notice how different this kind of message really is. Once CMO examined this diagram and said there's nothing new here, this is just marketing 101. It's a basic value proposition. But that's not the case at all. In fact, for many sales and marketing professionals, the ABC statement is completely counterintuitive relative to everything they've been trained to do in the past. How exactly? Consider this, when done well, who is the A about? It's about the customer. But then who is the be about? It's also about the customer. But if that's the case, then where in the world is the supplier in all of this? Now some like to say the supplier is in the arrow. But that's not really correct either. For what that arrow really represents is the behavior change the customer would have to undergo to get from A to B. So where is the supplier in the A to B statement? The answer is they aren't there at all. The AW statement isn't a story about the supplier. It's a story about the customer. Done properly, its supplier agnostic. That's pretty counterintuitive. Who ever heard of a supplier value proposition that doesn't include the actual supplier? But that's not really what the A to B represents. It's not so much a value proposition designed to articulate a suppliers capabilities as it is a value proposition designed to articulate the return from customer behavior change. That makes a lot of sense, since at the end of the day, that's exactly what a supplier is selling anyway. So if you wanted to assign a letter to the supplier, then arguably they would be the C. They're the natural end point of the AB story. For if a supplier effectively breaks down the A and then successfully builds up the B. That customer is going to look at that supplier and say I've got to change, but who can help me with this? That supplier must be able to say. Let me show you how. We are the only supplier that can help you with this. That's the power of commercial insight. So how does a commercial organization build something like that? We'll look at some very concrete examples in chapter 5, but here's a simple four question exercise to get you started. Four questions to build commercial insight. Admittedly, building commercial insight is not easy. It takes broad based commitment and collaboration across the entire commercial organization. Everyone from marketers to product managers to sales managers to sales reps to senior leaders, and arguably more. In fact, based on a widespread demand, CEB has been running a series of sold out workshops around the world for our members designed to help companies think through a step by step framework for building commercial insight. Our consulting arm has worked hand in hand with countless organizations to build not only commercial insights, but more sustainable commercial insight capabilities across those organizations. All of the work can be boiled down to four questions that can kickstart any companies commercial insight design efforts. Each question is designed to pick up a part of the story. We think you'll find these questions to be especially helpful as you start your own journey toward building commercial insight. Question #1. What are our sustainable, unique strengths? Remember, think broadly. Question #2. Of those unique strengths, which ones are currently under appreciated by our customers? This one is especially counterintuitive, as it forces you to think in the exact opposite direction of where you might naturally go on your own. After all, once you identify your unique, sustainable strengths, it seems like you'd be done. Put that in the value proposition and away you go. But remember, we just saw how that plays out. That's a story of the bee. What we're looking for is a story of the A. Question #3. What is it that the customer fails to fully understand about their business that leads them to underappreciate our unique sustainable capability now? Note the emphasis. This isn't a question of what the customer fails to understand about the suppliers business, it's a question of what the customer fails to understand about their own business. This is where a very different kind of customer understanding is absolutely crucial. This is the a with a view toward what the customer is missing. A different way to ask the same question might be what is there A and how is it broken? A clear understanding of the customer's current mental model allows us to then ask. Question #4. What would we have to teach that customer about their business that would lead them to value that capability more than they do now? Or put another way, how can we credibly break down their A and build up their B? We've run those four questions in workshop format with sales and marketing teams around the world, and the results are always fascinating. As a result of the exercise, commercial leaders are almost always surprised by both what they already know, if they just think about things a little bit differently, and what they don't really know because they never thought to ask. It's an exciting yet simultaneously humbling exercise, but it's virtually always a productive 1. For if nothing else, it leads to a series of natural follow on questions that can provide productive work streams for members of the commercial team. Things like. What kind of evidence would we need to credibly convince customers of what we're saying? How high is the burden of proof of our argument? How much of that evidence do we have now? How slash where could we build or buy the evidence that we're missing? For if we bring things full circle, remember that this is a story of activating mobilizers, engaging them in a conversation that they'll find compelling enough to want to act on, and then equipping them with the evidence they'll need to win over the other 4.4 despite potentially high levels of internal dysfunction. That is why commercial insight matters so much. It's less a solution for how suppliers struggle to sell and far more a solution for why customers struggle to buy. Or, more accurately, why they struggle so mightily to change. So let's move on to chapter four and breakdown the process of commercial insight creation in more detail with some concrete examples.\n"

      "Chapter 10. Shifting to a Challenger commercial model - implications and implementation lessons.  To win today, you need a challenger inside the customer organization. That is the central premise of this entire book. It turns out the far bigger story isn't about suppliers struggle to sell solutions, It's the customers struggle to buy them. Arming mobilizers with world class commercial insights and supporting their efforts to rally consensus for that insight and inherently then for your solution, requires a new go to market strategy. The implications of such a significant shift in commercial strategy are numerous. Sales and marketing must work together, bound by a new common language of disruption. Seller skills, something we covered in depth in the Challenger sale, must be reconsidered. Marketing content must be atomized and lead customers to a clear narrative that discloses what they've gotten wrong. There are likely sales coverage and territory implications for many organizations as more capable sales talent is aligned to prime growth markets. To say this shift happens overnight or even within a single year is not realistic. This shift takes time. It takes coordination among sales, marketing, and product teams. And above all else, it requires strong and continuous senior leadership support. That being said, there are a handful of implications that our research has highlighted as particularly tricky to navigate. What follows is by no means an exhaustive summary of change management paces. Instead, these are a series of implications that many organizations get wrong from the outset. Left untreated, these implications can undermine your organization's efforts to make this shift entirely. We'd even argue that attempting to make this shift without properly accounting for these implications is downright dangerous. So what are these implications? Implication #1 Demand generation. Most marketing teams aim their demand generation efforts at developing leads that are ready to buy. Traditional criteria of balance budget authority, need and timing dominate demand generation efforts. True, while this approach delivers a ready made customer to the sales team, it fails to do so on your terms. This approach does nothing to shape demand and create high quality leads. We call that mobilizing demand and we'll explore it here. Implication #2. Marketing talent. Most marketing teams are disproportionately focusing their skill building in the digital space. While we agree that's necessary to a degree, there are a set of skills related to the consensus purchase that are being overlooked. These skills are the ones that drive a marketer's ability to create and deploy commercial insight. These skills are more important than digital skills because go to market strategy rests upon them. Implication #3. Social selling. While it's clear that sales reps ought to be using social media tools to engage customers, we observe many social selling efforts that amount to little more than broadcasting, or perhaps more accurately, noise. Yet there's a powerful role for social media in the Mobilizer purchase. It centers on challenging mobilizer mental models in social media, where mobilizers increasingly go to learn. We'll explore how marketing and sales need to collaborate to deliver social teaching, not social selling. Implication #4 Managing blockers. Blockers can quickly demoralize your sales teams as they engage in consensus building efforts. Sellers must confidently address blockers and neutralize their influence for high quality consensus to be forged. Far and away the prevailing thought for managing blockers, however, is to ignore them. Rarely do sales methods teach approaches for blocker management. Even rarer are instances where sales managers ask who the blocker for a deal might be and what should be done to minimize their influence. So it should come as no surprise that sellers do the same, hoping the blocker goes away or relinquishes their objections. We'll explore several methods for actively managing blockers in this section. Implication #5. Sales Process and Opportunity Planning. The sales process has long centered on providing a clear frame of reference for seller actions, sequenced in order to maximize sales velocity, create a series of stages that dictate sales progress as well as govern next steps with customers. Remember, much of the commoditization pressure suppliers face today isn't the result of customers willingness to settle for good enough. It's their failure to agree on anything more. Today's sales process must better reflect how sellers can enable the right customer purchase behaviors rather than March a deal forward through the suppliers sales stages. Similarly, opportunity planning follows the same logic. Let's dive into these implications. Implication #1 Demand generation. In this section, we'll take a look at how marketing needs to rethink its demand generation system as a result of the insights CEB research has uncovered about the consensus purchase and the role of mobilizers. By demand generation system, we mean the people, process, technology and data that go into lead generation, lead scoring and lead nurturing. Clearly, this is a large and growing area of investment for marketing organizations, and it's a key piece of achieving greater marketing accountability. The stakes for getting this right couldn't be higher. Here's the risk boiled down to its simplest. If marketers rely on a bad go to market strategy to drive what they put into their demand Gen. systems and how they tune those systems out of the other side, they're going to get bad demand demand that leads to low quality commoditized deals as described in chapter one. Unfortunately, as we've researched all that's been written about demand generation in the blogosphere, we believe much of the conventional wisdom is based on an outdated conception of B to be purchasing. Based on the consensus and mobilizer dynamics uncovered by CEB Research, we believe the conventional wisdom is taking marketers in the wrong direction. If you pick up a white paper from most any marketing automation supplier or read A blog post from a content marketing guru, the conventional wisdom goes something like this. It's an increasingly noisy world, so breaking through to B to B buyers is tough. To breakthrough, you need great content. Great content isn't about you, it's about the customer. In fact, it's not about the demo from a graphic customer. For example, CIO's at companies larger than $100 million in revenue. It's about buyer archetypes or personas and their pain points and objectives. Businesses don't make purchase decisions. After all, People do. Personalize your content to these personas. Be present with your content in the spots they frequent. Say smart things so they think of you first when they're ready to evaluate suppliers. Set up your marketing automation to drive engagement with these personas to nurture them. Feed them content that further speaks to those persona pain points and objectives and whatever they need at that stage of the purchased journey. Measure purchase readiness by level of engagement and signals of bands budget authority. Need timing. Pass those nurtured leads to sales foreclosure. High fives all around. Open champagne to celebrate. Sounds great, doesn't it? Much of this wisdom feels so right. How could this possibly be so wrong? By now, having read the preceding chapters, chances are you can point to a few spots where this conventional wisdom might lead marketers astray. There are three main failure points. One conventional wisdom leads us down a path of creating ever more content, and content quantity quickly Trump's content quality. Coupled with the drive to generate leads and outbound marketing efforts, marketers risk turning off customers who are already bombarded with supplier messages. Two, conventional wisdom is mum on the absolute criticality of upending how customers think of their own business, thereby changing the customers direction when they are learning on their own. That means marketers will generate demand that commoditize their own solution. 3. Conventional wisdom is about better connecting individuals in a buying group to you as a supplier, not about connecting them to each other. So marketers will fail to lay the groundwork for the early consensus that needs to happen about the problem and the solution. Forget about the supplier. Let's unpack those in turn. The failures of demand generation. The first failure point is very straightforward. Marketing creates all of that content in its drive to engage, engage and engage. The thinking goes something like. Be present on a regular basis for each of my major personas in all the places they go for information. Since I've got all that content, go ahead and blast it out through e-mail campaigns and other outbound communications. Deep down, marketers know what happens here, right? Customers get turned off as the quality of content inexorably slips when marketing teams face the pressure of creating the quantity of content that conventional wisdom encourages. Customers inherently tune out suppliers, or even worse, they badmouth suppliers in social forums or refused to take visits from suppliers sales reps. We heard the following spooky anecdote from one prominent demand generation leader who heads up regional marketing for a Fortune 100 tech provider. Over an 18 month period, fully 60% of this suppliers opt in. Customer database has opted out. This supplier was no demand Gen. slouch either. They have been a pioneer in demand, Jen. In a crazy, noisy world, something starts to give if we continue to operate by an outbound engagement obsessed demand Gen. model. On the second failure path, the conventional wisdom. Approach will lead to smaller deals at lower margins by delivering what we call established demand. Established demand is the exact opposite of high quality deals that we discussed in Chapter one. Established demand comes from customers who learn on their own norm around minimum thresholds and then invite a supplier in to compete with two other suppliers in the Price based Bake Off. It's the one of three commoditization problem in spades. These are customers who might have read some of your thought leadership as they went about the research process. But they never had their perspective changed about the way their business currently works. So their view of what they need to purchase is established by the time you engage this customer. If you revisit the conventional wisdom, nowhere are we explicitly confronting customer mental models. However, that's what suppliers need to do to knock the commoditization freight train off its tracks. That's the way to change the customer's direction when they wait until they are 57% of the way through their purchase experience before reaching out to a supplier. In the conventional wisdom all marketers are called on to do is create content that speaks to customers known pain points or that demonstrates how smart they are as a supplier. Recall from chapter three, such approaches do not work because they don't change the customers direction. The conventional wisdom encourages that freight train. Vance based lead scoring criteria detect customers who have budget, a clear need and a set timeline for purchase. Leads that show all of these qualities garner more points in marketers, lead scoring systems and get passed to sales. Two main competitors to extract the best price. What sales Rep wants to waste time chasing that opportunity? This is one of the primary reasons our research shows that the highest performing sellers deprioritize marketing qualified leads. Let's touch on the third failure path, which has to do with consensus. The conventional wisdom would have marketers build stronger connections between their companies as suppliers and people in the customer organization. Marketing creates content that is tailored to personas, on the theory that if suppliers can engage those personas more deeply, they can boost customer willingness to buy from them and that will translate into more deals. But by now we know that individual willingness to buy in a consensus purchase means very little. The conventional wisdom largely misses this consensus dynamic. Personalizing messaging and content to such an extreme leads to driving diverse buying group stakeholders further apart. Even in the best case, this approach will lead suppliers to get a collection of individual yeses, but we know that's insufficient too. It's no wonder that based on CEB demand Gen. benchmarking research, only 3% of marketing qualified leads ever convert into deals. And that's on a good day. How many leads never have a chance to progress further because that stakeholder doesn't feel equipped to help Dr. consensus in her organization around the problem or solution, much less the supplier? Based on CEB research, that's likely happening to a large chunk of the 97% of marketing qualified leads that don't ever progress. Many of those prospect nibbles you get on your white papers, webinars, infographics and demand Gen. emails. Those are nibbles from solitary stakeholders making their daily rounds of industry news sites or LinkedIn groups. They engage because you spoke to their pain points, but they don't come away feeling there's any chance to overcome inertia and create consensus in their large organizations. And that's where the lead dies. Don't generate demand. Mobilize demand. To fix these failure points, suppliers need a demand generation system that accounts for the critical role of mobilizers in overcoming group dysfunction and stitching together consensus. It has to be one that accounts for the peak dysfunction of consensus happening 37% of the way through the purchase, long before sales reps meaningfully get involved. Here's what that looks like at a high level. We'll come back to unpack each one of these in more detail, but the themes will be familiar from what you've heard so far. One, create content paths that confront and connect. Recall from earlier chapters, we need Spark, Introduce, Confront Content for several reasons. It attracts the mobilizers we need. It forms the basis for collective learning at its most powerful, and thereby helps Dr. Consensus. The only way to change the customers direction is by changing their mental models, not through thought leadership or content that is useful to target personas. Moreover, if marketing has created those Spark introduced Confront Content paths for mobilizers to encounter and get pulled into, they are mobilizing high quality deals. Marketing is intercepting and changing the direction of mobilizers before any kind of consensus on the nature of the problem or solution is starting to gel in the customer organization. Through Spark, Introduce, Confront content marketing has greatly improved the chances of shaping that early demand to favor the suppliers unique strengths. Two are just lead scoring criteria to reflect confrontation and connection. Marketing should score leads in a way that gauges how much those leads have been disrupted by content and how well these suppliers content has connected buying group stakeholders within the same account to one another. To do that, marketing will need to tag content according to whether it 1 sparks, two introduces or three confronts. See Chapter 6 for more detail. That's well within the capabilities of content management and marketing automation technology today. Marketing will also want to assign more points for engaging multiple customer stakeholders on the same idea. So as marketing automation systems detect individual stakeholders engaging with content that is more disruptive, either introducing or personalizing disruptive ideas, marketing should also program those systems to detect when that stakeholder has shared that content or when peers stakeholders. In the same customer organization, have engaged with the same kinds of disruptive content. That kind of activity will indicate that groundwork is being laid for consensus in the customer organization. Marketing should assign more points to those leads. Clever design of content with sharing and targeted gating built in as in these skill soft mobilizer toolkit enables marketing to do this kind of lead scoring. Think about how powerful it is to know if you've got a prospective customer who is engaging with content that reflects your commercial insight and who is sharing that with other stakeholders. That's the kind of demand our systems should prioritize. See how different that is from typical bat based and engagement based scoring criteria. Instead of assigning points for purchase readiness bands, which tells you how close you are to capturing established demand that leads to commoditization. You are now gauging how disrupted the prospect is. As well, instead of scoring leads on individual engagement, where you assign progressively more points to content that requires more and more time from prospects, you are giving points for multi stakeholder consumption of counterintuitive content no matter what form it takes. Engagement for engagement sake is meaningless. Marketers should focus on spark, introduce, confront engagement that begins to rally the broader set of buying group stakeholders. Modest points for Spark Content, more points for Introduce Content and lots of points for Confront Content. Bonus points when any of this content is shared with or consumed by fellow account level stakeholders. 3 Nurture leads explicitly for commercial insight and collective learning. Now, when you have leads that aren't yet qualified to be passed to sales for closing, you'll know more precisely what to engage them with next. It will be driven by the likely state of mental disruption and stakeholder connectedness at a prospective account. For example, if you've generated a lead in which one stakeholder who has consumed spark and introduced content, and another lead from a stakeholder at the same account who has consumed only spark content, you might want to put confront Content in front of the first stakeholder and invite her to bring in the other stakeholder. Maybe that's a pain calculator or a diagnostic that the stakeholders work on together so they can learn around a common rallying point. Or perhaps this is where you'd suggest a collective learning workshop, bringing in the sales Rep to help execute. This is a very different approach to nurturing. The typical approach is oriented to feeding stakeholders with a predefined string of progressively more engaging content. Too often, engaging here means content that provides more detail and therefore takes more time to consume. They engaged with our infographic. Let's send them a white paper. Or they saw our white paper. Let's invite them to a webinar. Just because a piece of content provides more detail doesn't mean it's done anything at all to further overcome the customer's mental model or lay the groundwork for consensus. Because nurturing paths are built on customers, most common purchase path, one where they learn on their own and commoditize suppliers, marketers may be unwittingly feeding them content that greases the tracks for the commoditization freight train. How to Know if You're Mobilizing Demand? If you've taken these three steps to reorient your demand systems so that it mobilizes demand, what should you expect? How will common demand metrics move? In the following we layout the common demand indicators and how those are likely to change. This is important to understand because you're going to want to set expectations in the broader commercial organization and even the C-Suite on what will happen to demand as you reorient from generation to mobilization. If you're doing this well, overall lead volume may initially dip because you should be producing less content than you're putting into the marketplace. However, that new content will begin to take on a life of its own as it is more likely to get shared and picked up in earned media. Based on our experience working with commercial teams here, this can take upwards of 12 to 18 months, but you'll see lead volume increase. More important, lead quality will improve provided you've redefined lead quality to reflect emerging demand and not establish demand. That's because you've engineered content to attract mobilizers early on, when suppliers still have a chance to shape how the customer defines the problem and nature of the solution. Now, over time, as your improved content finds its way through earned and shared channels into a broader part of the marketplace, you may find that you get inbound inquiries that don't qualify as leads. You can catch the attention of a variety of marketplace actors and industry players, from industry associations to sole proprietors of small businesses to academics. Inquiries will increase because these players want to learn more about what was under that surprising content. But those should not be interpreted as poor leads or included in any kind of lead dashboard. The key metric to pay attention to here is therefore absolute volume of quality leads. Shifting from a generating demand to a mobilizing demand approach should also increase sales generated leads. Marketing should be equipping sales with counterintuitive social sound bites to help reps engage customers early in their passive learning process on LinkedIn and other social communities. See the implication on social selling later in this chapter. Because Spark introduced Confront Content is more likely to catch attention and get shared, it should boost sales reps ability to source leads through their own social networks. Win rates and deal profitability should also increase. You should be able to get ahead of the RFP and influence not just buying criteria, but the minimum thresholds of performance for those criteria. That translates to higher win rate, larger deal size and or larger margins. Based on CEB research and our members experiences, 15 to 20% price premiums are not unusual for demand that is mobilized and carried through to the sales interaction. It's the same effect that John Goetz, the Xerox account executive, described back in Chapter 5 in Using the Color Drive Student Performance Insight. It's as if the door closes, I'm on the inside and everyone else is on the outside. So far so good. Higher volume of quality leads after an initial downtick. Larger deals, better margins, higher close rates. But what about sales cycle time? There are multiple forces driving cycle times in different directions here. It's very likely that prospective customers will encounter that Spark introduced Confront Content earlier in their purchase journey. They may encounter content in a passive learning stage, perhaps in earned media, before they even begin the journey. That can, in a way, start the purchase clock early if you measure cycle time from the first moment that you have a lead through to deal clothes. All else equal, that might extend sales cycle time. On the flip side, there are also forces shortening sales cycle time. By engaging mobilizers early and equipping them with content and tools that they use to drive consensus in the buying group and surface stakeholder objections early, you canmore effectively build Deal momentum, much like Alpha Company accomplished in its Collective Learning workshops from Chapter 9. That will enable those buying groups to agree on more larger problems and more valuable solutions, and more quickly than if you aren't connecting them early to overcome group dysfunction. Soft indicators of success. If you step back to look at the big picture on KPIs, you'll see that motivating this shift in content and demand generation strategy takes some courage. You're likely to face short term pressure on lead, quality and cycle time as you give the marketplace a chance to digest content. It has to work its way through sharing channels. It has to get noticed and picked up in earned media and by influencers. Mobilizers have to encounter that content, share it with fellow stakeholders and rally around it. As we've talked to CEB members who have been on this demand mobilization journey, they shared with us the confidence giving softer indicators that let you know you're on the right track, especially in the face of some dashboard KPI's that may move temporarily in the wrong direction. You can visualize in a demand funnel. In the pre funnel stage, you'll know you're on the right track if you experience these kinds of things. Proprietary term adoption. You'll begin to see terms that you've coined get used in social media or maybe even adopted by the broader marketplace. See the Cisco example from Chapter 9. Third party references earned media outlets, notable bloggers, and other influencers will start to reference your commercial insight. They love surprising or counterintuitive information, after all. Invitations to present your insights. Rather than having to pay for event sponsorships, you'll start to get invited to present on your commercial insight. That's because your content is less likely to be about you as a supplier and more about these surprising things going on in your customers businesses. If you experience any of these kinds of events, you'll know you're on the right track. Likewise, you should start to see the following kinds of soft indicators in the demand funnel itself. Early engagement with new key decision makers. Your content is winning early Salesforce engagement with decision makers, ones that you hadn't engaged before. Recall from chapters 5 and six how Xerox was able to engage with a new set of more senior decision makers outside of IT. Positive sales force sentiment on lead quality. You'll hear instances of very positive feedback from the sales force on the different in kind discussions that they are able to have with marketing sourced leads who are primed by your content to learn more about your commercial insight and how it applies to their business. Instances of getting ahead of the RFP slash. No bid contracts. You'll hear examples from your sales force of content helping to get ahead of the RFP or spark no bid contract situations. Recall from Chapter 9 how Skill Sauce Mobilizer Toolkit is enabling this. When you experience these kinds of events, celebrate them. Share credit liberally with your team and your sales colleagues. If you've done this right, they were your copilots all along in designing a demand mobilization system. Above all, take courage to fight through the tough parts of the journey. Companies who have moved in this direction, like Xerox, Smart Skill Soft and others tell us the prize is worth the fight. Implication #2. Marketing talent. The chief talent question marketing leaders should be interested in is have I got the right marketer talent to thrive in the world of the consensus purchase? CEB has studied this question quantitatively with special focus on marketers abilities to generate and deploy commercial insight. After all, commercial insight is the key to engaging mobilizers early. If you can get that right, you'll have set your commercial organization up for success against the consensus dynamic. Here's the key take away. Commercial insight, skills and knowledge are in short supply. Moreover, it takes a special blend of those skills and knowledge put into the right operating environment to successfully build and deploy commercial insight. In other words, this can't be left to chance or to heroism on the marketing team. Marketing leaders need to step in to engineer the right kinds of working teams and create a particular kind of environment that nurtures commercial insight creation. Now here are the details. To study this, we conducted survey based quantitative research. We surveyed over 580 marketers in different roles and at different levels from 29 different B to B suppliers around the world. In these surveys, we had marketers self assess their performance across a wide range of attributes, skills, attitudes, knowledge, experience and their work environment. We then had the heads of marketing from each of those companies assess each of their survey participants on their ability across four skills we consider crucial to commercial insight creation. Finally, we then use statistical analysis to determine of all the things you could do well as a marketer, what matters most in building and deploying commercial insight. Here's what we found. First, let's look at the four skills we used as a proxy for commercial insight ability. These are the four skills that heads of marketing scored each of their people on. We looked at marketers ability to one generate insight that reshapes how customers think about their business. To understand and articulate their companies differentiated capabilities and benefits. Three, connect those insights about customers back to the suppliers 's unique capabilities. Four, package all of that in compelling messages across a variety of content types, including sales collateral and other sales support. These are the commercial insight indicators or outcomes we studied. In a moment, we'll take a look at the drivers of these indicators. But let's pause on these indicators for a moment. The first observation is on a scale of 1 to 5, marketers are pretty average at these commercial insight indicators as judged by their marketing leaders. Not great, not horrible, just sort of neutral. There is clearly room to run on improving marketers performance on the skills that matter most for commercial insight. One thing worth noting, when we conducted the survey, we specifically asked participating heads of marketing to select only those members of their team who play a role in the creation of content and messaging. So this is an X-ray of the messaging and content engine itself. When you look at the distribution of marketer performance, you'll find that only one out of four marketers averages above a four. Major deals arise from understanding the customers business better than they understand it themselves, At least where your capabilities intersect the customer business. This is a high bar we're talking about here. When we think about the level of skill we need, it's troubling to see how few marketers excel at the skills required to counter customers thinking. It raises an interesting challenge for marketing leaders. How do I get more of my team above that threshold? Can I shift them there, or will I need to hire new people altogether? To answer that question, we need to better understand the drivers of our four commercial insight indicators. We included a wide variety of potential drivers in our survey. What you see are the factors that mattered most in driving marketers commercial insight indicators. They bundle into five statistically significant drivers. Think of these as categories of attributes that naturally move together and drive those four commercial insight indicators. In case you're wondering about the scores, the number represents the increase in score on a 5 point scale that we'd expect to see if we improve performance from below average to above average. So for example Customer native measures 0.21. That means improving from bottom quartile to top quartile performance on customer native attributes would increase a marketers commercial insight performance on a 5 point scale by 0.21 points. Now you're probably wondering, is 0.21 points a lot? Seems kind of small. But when you Add all these scores together, which represents improvement on all these skills, you see a very dramatic impact on overall Commercial Insight performance. If you were to realize the full benefit of each of these scores combined, that would mean moving a marketer from average level of Commercial insight performance to the top 15%. That's a big deal because it means moving into the zone of creating and deploying commercial insight that can lead to a quantum jump in commercial results. Let's unpack what's in each of these scores. To understand what's underneath these findings, we have to transport ourselves into the actual meetings where these teams are trying to generate commercial insight in the first place. They're looking for potential hidden connections in the customers business that customers themselves fail to appreciate. They're hunting for clues to find these connections. They're mapping customer mental models depicting how that customer's business works and how they make money. They're looking for a place in that model where they can tell customers they're wrong. Then they're finding creative ways to spark, introduce and confront customers with those messages at arms length. That's not easy. So what does it take? Well, First things first, let's unpack the first driver, customer native. What this driver captures is a world class marketers ability to truly understand the customer, their motivations, their decisions, how they speak, what they're thinking. For example, within this driver you'll find activities like hypothesized needs. The best commercial insight marketers can anticipate customer needs before the customers themselves. This goes way beyond asking customers what they need or staring at backward looking data about what customers have ordered. This demands a knowledge of customers that lets you hypothesize what they don't yet even realize they need. That's the key to teaching. It's all about finding unrecognized customer needs. That second biggest driver is labeled investigative. This is more about the posture and traits of the folks you want on the Commercial Insight team. Think of this as a detective type of posture. Always asking why? Sorting through mountains of ambiguous information. Testing assumptions. These marketers are looking for clues in their customers business environment, in their own data about customers, in current market trends and especially in unusual customer stories that might normally be dismissed. All with the aim of connecting information in new ways to show customers how their mental models are off base. Also note the not overly confident sub driver under the investigative heading. There's a type of marketer out there who runs against this investigative posture that you definitely do not want on your commercial insight team. That's the overconfident marketer who assumes he already knows what the customer needs and rationalizes away any evidence to the contrary. The third biggest driver is labeled business savvy. This one is really interesting not just for what it is, but also for what it's not. It turns out marketers with a consulting or strategic planning background perform well on our four commercial insight indicators, and people with a deep background in data, slash analytics or creative design don't. Why? Well, the business savvy brings two things to the table. First, these folks are already good at building and tearing down mental models. That's essentially what consulting or strategic planning has trained them to do. Work through complex and ambiguous problems. They live for that. Second, they bring with them an extensive mental library of business and economic frameworks, how money is made and how business models work in a whole range of industries and situations. That's a critical ingredient for landing on commercial insight, finding the hidden connections that aren't just hidden but economically meaningful. Think about dense ply and the modeling of absenteeism cost on the profitability of the dentist practice. Those are the first three sets of drivers. They all fit under a people heading because they're more about the attributes of the individual people who are building and deploying commercial insight. It's a special blend of skills, background and knowledge. The data tells us it's quite likely that you wouldn't find this blend in any single person. That's borne out in our experience working with organizations on commercial insight, too. Building and deploying commercial insight is more of a team sport. Commercial leaders will probably have to look beyond marketing to product strategy, sales insights, maybe even R&D to find the right people mix here. The crucial implication is staffing for commercial insight can't be left to chance. It's not to be taken on by a casual mix of frontline marketers or volunteers. Commercial leaders need to deliberately engineer the right blend of people. Now commercial leaders also need to set the right operating conditions for these people to work in. That's what the last two drivers speak to and why we put them under an environment heading. The first one of these two drivers is Co creative teams. Coming up with commercial insight is an organic, interactive, synthetic exercise. As a result, commercial leaders have to foster an environment where sharing and building on one another's ideas is not just encouraged. But expected. Remember, commercial insight, by definition is disruptive. Some of the best ideas are going to seem pretty far fetched at first glance. They'll run counter. To how customers currently view their world. Under this driver, we observe that the best performing teams have marketing and sales working together on this, collaborating to build on each other 's experience and synthesize different ideas, and willing to accept when their ideas may not win out. Also under this Co creative teams driver, we observed an interesting dynamic about the high performing teams not feeling like it was necessary to take turns to talk. We think this one showed up because commercial organizations often bring together teams that are too large to generate commercial insight. Four to five people is the ideal size. If you've got 7-8 or more, chances are pretty good you've already made some sacrifices on the people's skills and traits we've discussed. Then, whenever you get groups that large, the team feels compelled to include everyone's thinking, and that dilutes your keen insights. It's the one pizza rule. If you have to order two pizzas to feed the team for late night work sessions, the team is too big. The second of the environment drivers is encourage risks. By now, this one should come as no surprise. Generating commercial insight is fundamentally a creative task, and if you don't encourage risk taking, you're not going to get the lateral thinking and outlier ideas that end up being the richest kernels of commercial insight. If you are to get breakthrough commercial insight, this is the kind of people mix and environment you need to engineer as marketing leaders. This responsibility extends to sales and product leaders as well, given the mix of talent that is required to generate commercial insight. Implication #3 Social selling. In chapter five, we focused on using content to challenge mobilizers mental models early. It's absolutely critical for marketing to do this, but that doesn't mean commercial organization should give up on getting sales reps to engage with mobilizers to begin breaking down the A as early as possible. The rise of social media gives occasion for marketing and sales to work together to create these early teaching opportunities. It looks very different from the typical broadcast approach we see commercial organizations taking to do social selling. One of the key questions that our research highlighting that customers are 57% of the way through a purchase surface is if customers are delaying contact with supplier sales reps, how is it that some sales reps are still managing to get in early? What are they doing differently? So we studied sales Rep behavior to find out. That question led us to study sales Rep behavior on engaging customers early, bringing both quantitative and qualitative research methods to bear, and unearthed an important set of insights. We fielded a survey to over 1000 sales reps from 23B to B companies across all kinds of industries. We tested over 90 sales Rep attributes and behaviors, all related to getting in early with customers. Then we conducted over 100 structured interviews with sales reps, managers and leaders, all with an eye to understanding what separates high performers from average performers when it comes to getting in early. The single most powerful behavior separating high performers from core performers is using social media as a critical channel to engage customers and generate leads. What exactly does it mean to use social media in the context of getting in early? Well, when you unpack the data, it comes down to three things. One connecting with potential customers. Two, using social networks like LinkedIn and Twitter to share points of view valuable to customers. Three, using social media for lead generation. When we talked to a number of sales reps having huge success with this approach, what we found is this all adds up to positioning oneself as a key influencer within social networks. To do that, we found the best reps worked very hard to tap into a large social network extending far beyond personal contacts and current customers. These reps are accessing the entire ecosystem of the marketplace that that Rep sells into. So not just existing customers, but potential customers. Even people who might never be your customer, but could potentially buy your product in another territory through a different channel or through another supplier altogether. But that's just the beginning. Then there are channel partners, industry experts, market influencers, complementary suppliers, influencers from similar or adjacent industries, you name it. Basically, it's anyone and everyone who might be interested in engaging in a conversation around the broadest set of issues your products and services potentially touch. So the best reps Find the watering holes or those online communities where people in their industry gather and learn. In advanced cases, the very best reps will serve as teaching connectors, serving as a hub, bringing this group of people together in order to engage in a learning conversation around a common interest. Done well, sales reps who play this role as Teaching Connector are much more likely to attract mobilizers into their orbit. Now there are clearly ways that refuse of social media can go wrong. The best reps who are involved in social media are very careful how they use it. The last thing star performers would do with this powerful network they've tapped into is use it to broadcast messages with no interaction or teaching. In other words, using it purely as an advertising channel. Yet we see far too much of social selling happening in exactly this way. No one has any patience for posts like. Just wanted to let you know our new XP Nine 100 is out next month pre-order today. We've all been on the receiving end of this kind of message on LinkedIn. That's not what this channel is for. Rather, it's about actively engaging in a productive, interesting conversation. Ideally, conversation that teaches. It fits right into the spark introduced Confront model from Chapter 6. Social watering holes are the ideal place to spark a target audience into exploring your ideas by sharing surprising data, insights and provocative viewpoints. Because commercial insights are by definition not about you as a supplier, but about customers, they are much less likely to be rejected on the grounds of being commercially slanted. One star performing sales Rep we talked to in the healthcare space summed it up nicely, she told us. You've got to weave yourself into the knowledge fabric where your customers learn, but you've got to earn that right. You've got to help the customer think differently than they would have otherwise. Now in some industries, there are more social watering holes and opportunities for our customers and ecosystem partners to learn and engage in conversations. There are some regulated spaces like healthcare and financial services where social media growth has been stunted. But we've been consistently surprised at how far and wide social watering holes are extending to some B to B categories where you'd never expect it. Chemistry. Check. Material science? Yep. Auto dealership finance and insurance? Uh-huh. We're seeing leading marketing and sales functions tag team to get this right. Suppliers like IBM, Cisco, National Instruments and others are blazing the trail here. When it comes to social media, marketers complain that it's difficult to scale efforts there because social media is so time and labor intensive. Well, these organizations realize that in sales they have multiple times the people power that marketing can bring to bear. We view this kind of social enablement as a critical part of the larger commercial strategy to teach mobilizers and disrupt their mental models early, ideally when they are passively learning, but certainly before the 57% point when they are picking up the phone to talk to a sales Rep. Teach where and when customers learn. Implication #4 Managing blockers. There are times and situations where a purchase bogs down. Where a stakeholder is so incredibly entrenched in their own views and won't budge. As we covered earlier in this book, we affectionately call these fine folks blockers, though chances are good your sales teams use far more colorful language to describe them. Blockers readily derail consensus building and collective learning efforts, spoiling any chance of a new view emerging. When we've interviewed sellers on how to best engage a blocker, a litany of hilarious responses usually ensued. Get them fired or football tickets or humiliate them are among our favorites. Perhaps there is a time and place for any of those actions, but invariably the number one response we heard is ignore them. For years, the conventional wisdom has been to avoid blockers altogether, like an ostrich burying its head in the sand, hoping they will somehow disappear. However, there is one problem with that strategy. Blockers don't go away or stay on the sidelines. They are present, either knowingly or unknowingly, in virtually every deal. Depending on their influence, blockers have a powerful ability to stall and derail the most promising of deals. Fortunately, across the course of our research, we've identified a number of proven, proactive strategies to address and neutralize deal blockers. As a reminder, a blocker is a customer stakeholder who tries to prevent a supplier from closing a deal, whether because they dislike the supplier, prefer a competing supplier, or want to maintain the status quo. Like the mobilizer, blockers don't fall into any pattern of seniority, buying role or functional role. Unfortunately, they come in all shapes and sizes with different influencing levels. Making matters worse, the blocker isn't necessarily even known to the supplier. They could be known, unknown, or even what we would call stealth blockers. Those who vocalize support to the salesperson but then turn around and torpedo the deal behind the scenes. With the inclusion of one or more blockers in any given deal, a supplier's chances of making a high quality sale decrease by 47%. As you well know, blockers are present in virtually every deal. Therefore logic would say that from the get go for most deals, you have only a 53% chance of making a high quality sale. Scary stuff. As most sales managers will attest, salespeople rarely engage blockers effectively. Most salespeople ignore the blockers who are lying in wait to undermine their deals, hoping that they can rally enough support to overrule a blockers objections. We've observed the best sales managers quite literally forced discussion of blockers amongst their sales teams. These sales managers are taught to ask questions like if I told you we were overlooking a blocker to this deal, who would you guess it would be and why? The wording alone is smart. The question doesn't allow the seller to say that there are no blockers. They can't default to their natural tendency, in other words. Another powerful question used by managers is what types of stakeholders typically block deals like this. A great question for prompting the seller to think about similar deals and where there might be common blocker tendencies. Blockers are tricky stakeholders and they will state objections that they think will align with other stakeholders. Objections as they don't want to be seen as explicitly rocking the boat. This makes it hard to uncover a blocker's true concerns. Good managers will ask more straightforward questions like has the blocker had any negative interactions with us in the past? But he or she will also layer in questions that dig at potential underlying concerns like. How could this purchase make the blockers work more difficult? Finally, good sales managers will commit to a plan for managing the blocker. The goal here is to address the salespersons tendency to delay interactions with blockers. What is our strategy for dealing with the blocker prompts action from the sales team? OK, so how do you manage blockers? The first question sellers should ask themselves is can the blocker be persuaded by the supporters in the stakeholder group? In other words, can social pressure be applied to neutralize the blocker? Can they be influenced by mobilizers and other supporters within the stakeholder group? If the answer is yes, you want to apply social pressure through collective learning. As we discussed in this chapter, collective learning involves the exploration of objections, concerns and uncertainties among stakeholders surfacing disconnects, and competing viewpoints. Each of these actions is designed to get everyone on the same page, including the blocker. You're hoping to turn the blocker into a supporter, or at the very least mitigate or decrease their influence on the collective group. In addition to creating a collective learning interaction, these social pressures can be used to counteract a blocker. Conducting a workshop or other event where stakeholders can exchange views with the blocker. Identifying influencers that the blocker respects and having your mobilizer, broker and interaction. Arming your mobilizer or other influencers with information to convince the blocker to support the deal. Encouraging influencers to share why others are supporting the deal. In our research, we found that collective learning decreases likelihood of encountering a blocker by 20%. Further, there is a 35% increase in the likelihood of making a high quality sale when collective learning occurs within a stakeholder group that has a blocker. That's an extremely significant jump and underscores the importance of collective learning. The reason we try this tactic first is not only is it hugely effective, but also it's the lowest risk of all the tactics. Social pressure doesn't carry terribly high stakes. Sure, the blocker might get annoyed if colleagues want them to stand down, but that's about the worst outcome. What explains this impact? Engaging in collective learning creates a larger proportion of supporters in the stakeholder group, reducing the proportion of both neutrals and blockers, in turn reducing the impact of the remaining blockers. Blockers may still exist despite high collective learning. So if applying social pressure through collective learning does not turn or minimize the influence of the blocker, what do we do next? The second question that the seller should ask themselves is does the blocker seem reasonable and approachable? If yes, then the sellers should attempt to communicate through tailored dialogue to persuade the blocker to allow the deal to move forward. Note that we are not yet at the stage where we want to be making concessions. We will get to that in a moment. Different motivating factors drive different types of blocker behaviors. Some want to avoid change, some want the competition to win the business, and some simply want to see you lose the business. One of the blocker types, the Pro Status Quo Blocker, is best engaged by listening to and empathizing with their concerns regarding change. First, show that you understand their concerns, but also later reinforce the risks of not changing, creating urgency for the offering. You can also offer to connect them to previous or existing customers who had similar concerns. For the pro competitor blocker type, you should engage them in discussing the main motivation for making a purchase in general agnostic of supplier. Then explain how you can help them achieve their goals in a way that other suppliers cannot. For the anti supplier blocker type, you should engage by asking them to lay out their honest thoughts about you as a supplier, no matter how brutal. Acknowledge the truth in their perspective and share how you are committed to addressing and making up for your past mistakes. Take note that direct engagement tactics carry greater risk. The chances of the blocker taking a personal disliking towards you increase, and that's baggage no one wants to carry within a deal. But if social pressure failed to work, you may need to resort to this tactic. So what do you do if your blockers are not reasonable or approachable? Or if your efforts to communicate fall short? At this point, it's now time to think about making a concession. The third question that the sellers should ask as part of the progression is does the blocker have concerns about a specific aspect of the offering? If the answer is yes, consider making a targeted concession. Alter the deal to make it appealing, but not entirely commercially damaging to your organization. Now, concessions are tricky and by no means does this approach provide an exhaustive set of guidance for concessions or negotiation, but we can provide some general guidelines to follow when considering and developing concessions. First, thoroughly plan ahead and identify negotiable and non negotiable aspects of the deal. This knowledge is crucial for how you formulate your concession strategy. Second, take those negotiable aspects and hypothesize which aspects the blocker will react positively to and be more inclined to accept. Third, when developing the concession, you obviously want to concede as little as possible for your own benefit, but furthermore want to ensure that you do not endanger your support from other stakeholders because of a now watered down or no longer worthwhile solution. 4th To the earlier point, you need to get explicit support for this new vision of the deal from our set of supportive stakeholders. 5th Practicing good negotiating hygiene. Secure a guarantee from the blocker and other supporters that the deal will go through based on the new vision, preventing further concessions and further delays. You want to ensure that all the work that went in the concession leads to results, otherwise you have wasted time. And money. Again, you've stepped up the level of risk by altering the deal. It's possible that collateral damage is now done and chances are good that you've had to remove something versus making the deal bigger. Active trade-offs are now being made and that's definitely more risky for your commercial outcomes. If you get to the point where making a concession does not work, you then need to go to the final and last option. Escalate. The question you're sellers should ask themselves at this point is do senior leaders at the customer organization have an interest in this deal closing? If yes, you want to leverage someone more senior than the blocker to help grease the wheels and encourage the blocker to allow the deal to push forward. This is clearly the riskiest option and carries significant political ramifications for the blocker. It may potentially endanger their job or career path. Going over the top of the blocker and escalating is certainly a last resort type of option. To that end, let's take a look at some of the action steps and guidelines for the escalation strategy. First, contact one of the blockers leaders and explain the situation. But pick carefully. You'll want to pick a leader who you think can professionally manage the situation and would be receptive to escalation. Someone who can be trusted with mitigating the potential awkwardness of the situation. Second, ensure the leader understands the blockers motivations. Don't just approach them and say Johnny is not playing nice. You want to avoid making this an attack on the blocker. Provide the leader with a balanced perspective so they can judge and take action accordingly and professionally. Third, and this is contingent on steps one and two, if the blocker continues to stall the deal, you can ask the leader to overrule the blockers influence. Now this has the greatest potential for some scorched earth, and we would certainly view this as a last resort tactic. You obviously have to take into account the blockers influence for future deals and account growth. In parallel with all of those steps, it is paramount that you keep our supporters at the customer organization informed and in the loop to avoid concern around the deal, but also to continue the collective pressure that they might be able to exert on the blocker, either explicitly or implicitly. What happens if this strategy fails? At this point, you then have to seriously consider whether you want to actively pursue this opportunity any longer. Is it worth it? Does it still make business sense? That decision is going to depend on the nuances of your business and the type of deal. But in general, our view is that if a deal gets to this point, it's best to put it on the back burner, passively pursue and focus elsewhere. Just to recap, remember. Blockers cannot and should not be ignored. Their impact is immense and as we state here, blockers reduce the likelihood of making a high quality deal by 47%. Managers play a critical role. They can help lessen the likelihood of a blocker obstructing a deal by forcing sellers to identify blockers and conceive engagement strategies early on. You can minimize a blockers impact and influence, but you can't necessarily eliminate it altogether. Collective learning minimizes A blockers impact, but more aggressive engagement strategies may still be needed. The importance of collective learning can't be understated in today's consensus driven purchase, where divergent views and dysfunction reigns supreme and deals get compressed and compressed to the lowest common denominator. It's the means by which we can help our mobilizers forge a purchase decision. It brings diverse stakeholders, including blockers and procurement, together to make a meaningful decision. Implication #5. Sales Process and Opportunity Planning. Buying made easy. The challenges of today's customer purchase experience have been highlighted throughout this book. If there is one take away you should have from all the research and best practices shared to this point, it's this. Commercial organizations need to place far greater emphasis on supporting the customer's purchase process. One of our all time classic best practices comes from an organization that has done just that and shifted their entire sales process to more of a purchase enablement process. The company is ADP, the global payroll and human Capital Management firm, and this is their buying made easy purchase process. At first glance, ADP's approach might look a lot like your run-of-the-mill sales process. On closer examination, however, you'll realize this is very different. The first thing you'll notice is that ADP doesn't have a sales process at all. This is actually a very structured approach to moving deals through a customers buying process. This is precisely why ADP refers to this approach as buying Made Easy. This entire approach is designed to support the customer through a series of customer outcomes throughout a typical purchase experience. How most companies design A sales process, of course, is by mapping out the activities known to drive commercial success. Sellers are then expected to execute those activities as effectively and efficiently as possible. The idea being that if sellers do these things in this order, the chances of the customer purchasing are maximized. But what ADP is doing is different. From their perspective, the real question isn't how do we help our reps better sell, but rather how can our sales teams help our customer better buy. This process is predicated upon the major decision stages that nearly any customer will undergo, including one recognizing a need. This is where the customer initially determines a reason to explore a potential purchase, whether based upon an opportunity.\n",
      "Chapter One. The dark side of customer consensus.  This is a book of surprises. Chief among them is the surprising decline of historically effective selling strategies that now fail to generate anything near hoped for returns. Despite suppliers improved ability to convey their unique value, there's strong evidence that today's customers are less willing than ever before to actually pay for that value even when they perceive it. At least not when they believe the next, best, less expensive alternative is good enough to meet their needs. While today's suppliers may win the battle for awareness, consideration, recommendation and even preference, they still lose when it comes to what matters most. Getting paid. As exasperating as it seems, the very solutions most companies develop to escape commoditization have themselves become commoditized in the eyes of their customers. It all leaves commercial leaders wondering, what do we do now? What's left when the classic sales and marketing playbook we've relied on for so many years falls short? It was partly in response to these questions that CEB Sales and Marketing Practice conducted the research that led to the publication of the Challenger sale. An in-depth examination of the sales Rep behavior is most likely to succeed in today's commercial environment. But while the debate raged around us as to whether Challenger was right or wrong, new or old, too controversial or not controversial enough, we were focused on something else entirely. What else is there? In fact, the more research we did, the more insights we uncovered, and the more convinced we became that there was a second part to this story. One potentially more powerful than the first. It turns out the far bigger story isn't about suppliers struggle to sell solutions, It's the customers struggle to buy them. While there are many reasons customers fail to buy, our data shows clearly that the primary culprit is the dramatic increase in both number and diversity of customer stakeholders typically involved in solutions purchases today and more damning, the severe dysfunction that is bred by the ever expanding number of individuals who need to weigh in before a deal is signed. In the end, what has long seemed to salespeople like a well designed strategy to stick it to suppliers or beat them up on price is more often than not a function of a far less sinister but arguably infinitely more intractable problem. The inability of customers, stakeholders themselves, to achieve broad agreement on a common course of action in the first place. Much of the commoditization pressure suppliers face today isn't the result of customers willingness to settle for good enough. It's their failure to agree on anything more. And that's a challenge most sales and marketing strategies fail to solve, as it's a problem they were never designed to address in the first place. In fact, current sales and marketing tactics exacerbate this problem rather than overcome it. Of course, it's hard enough to sell effectively. How exactly are we supposed to help our customers to buy more effectively? Here, the research holds a final, delightful surprise. Just as we learned in our previous work that it is critical to have Challenger sellers, our latest work shows that it is equally, if not more, critical to have Challenger buyers. In a series of quantitative studies, we were able to isolate and study these individuals. These aren't your run-of-the-mill coaches or advocates doling out information to the sales Rep and vocally championing a given supplier with colleagues. These are a special breed of customer stakeholder focused much more on marshalling the internal resources and buy in necessary to compel their colleagues to collectively think and act beyond the status quo irrespective of supplier. As we've studied these individuals in a great deal of depth, what we've found is in a world of diverse and potentially dysfunctional customer stakeholders, it's not just that you challenge, but who you challenge that really matters. To win today, you need a challenger inside the customer organization. These customer challengers exist and can be found, but only if suppliers are looking for them in the first place. Because everything we've learned in all of our research clearly suggests that finding these individuals, winning them over, and then equipping them to win takes a completely different kind of commercial strategy than what's worked so well in the past. Who are these customer challengers? We call them mobilizers, and this is their story.  The problem of one of three. If there is one concern most top of mind among senior sales and marketing leaders around the world, it is the inexorable downward pressure on deal size, margins and growth as they navigate continued uncertain times. While their CEO's mandate a return to double digit growth. Commercial leaders find themselves more frequently than ever before, competing on little else but price. Perhaps most frustrating, however, is that traditionally proven strategy is designed to drive that growth No longer work nearly as well as they used to, leaving senior executives to assume they've somehow lost their way, broadly calling for a return back to basics as they exhort their teams to. Recommit to more disciplined execution. However, getting ever better at an approach already proven to fail does little more than demoralize everyone in the face of ever deepening underperformance. As the head of sales and marketing at a global industrial fragrances company recently put it. I just don't understand. We're the leading supplier in our industry. Our products are world class, our brands second to none, and our salespeople are highly skilled. There's not a single deal in our industry where we're not invited to participate. We make it to the table every single time. But even when we do, he went on, we're always one of three suppliers at the table. Despite all of our commercial strength, we end up competing on nothing but price every single time. It's killing our business. Our premium position simply can't sustain that kind of margin erosion. It's an incredibly common, but still maddeningly frustrating scenario. Here's a company that excels across every commercial metric that might matter, but still faces deep commoditization nonetheless. Welcome to what we've come to call the one of three problem, where a supplier commonly wins the battle for customer consideration, even preference, but ends up competing against two others on little but price nevertheless. How to respond? Typically, heads of sales and marketing would tell you if customers fail to fully pay us for all the incremental value we provide, then clearly they must not appreciate all the incremental value we provide. So they direct their teams to sharpen the company's value proposition. They equip reps to more crisply articulate the many ways in which their company can not only meet customers needs, but exceed them. Be carefully redesigned marketing campaigns and sales collateral to better communicate the broad range of their companies best in class, cutting edge solutions and unique ability to provide moments of deep customer delight. And yet in today's world, even when delivered well, most customers reaction to suppliers costly efforts to better articulate their company's value isn't so much wow, we had no idea, but rather something closer akin to yeah, we knew that already. Today's customers will often concede the point right up front. Responding. We totally agree. We think you guys are great, Your solution is by far the best and we'd love to partner with you. Which feels fantastic until they add. In fact, that's why you're one of the three companies we've invited to participate in this bidding process. But as much as we love your solution, this other company solution is good enough and they're a lot cheaper. So if we can get your solution at their price, then we're good to go. And that's painful. Despite suppliers best efforts to better convey their unique value, there is little evidence that today's customers are any more willing to pay for that value even when they perceive it. At least not when they believe the next best alternative to be sufficiently good enough. So a supplier wins in every way possible, raising awareness, consideration, preference, even recommendations, and still loses when it comes to what matters most. Getting paid. This is the core dilemma of selling solutions. Today most suppliers single biggest competitor isn't so much the competition's ability to sell as their own customers willingness to settle. Across the last five years, the CEB team has dug into this challenge with a huge amount of research into both sales and marketing capability and customer buying behavior, seeking to understand what suppliers can do differently going forward to avoid the underperformance of past approaches. What we've learned is fascinating, if not more than a little bit troubling. Much of the problem lies less in a supplier organizations inability to sell effectively and far more in a customer organizations inability to buy effectively. And a very large part of that challenge lies squarely in customers struggle to achieve common agreement across the wide range of stakeholders now typically involved in virtually any solutions purchase. The rise and fall of the 5.4. One might argue that the challenge of customer consensus is nothing new. Indeed, we've been hearing of the problem for years. And of course the economic downturn in 2009 did nothing but exacerbate the problem as increasingly cost conscious and risk averse decision makers balked at making even the smallest decisions on their own. And yet, if we Fast forward to today, the strange thing is while the global economy has significantly rebounded across virtually every metric that might matter, in that same time, the customer consensus challenge has become far worse. In a recent survey of senior sales leaders, we found nearly 80% reported the number of customer stakeholders involved in a typical deal continues to rise. Why? There are all sorts of reasons for the added number of individuals involved in a deal today, but chief among them would be. 1A Sustained and widespread aversion to risk among both individual customer stakeholders and organizations in the aftermath of the global economic crisis. Two, the fact that most solutions today have both a technological component and a higher price tag, necessitating not only the involvement of IT, but additional scrutiny by operations and procurements executives. 3A Greater concern among legal and compliance officers that all corporate initiatives meet tighter regulatory requirements and information protection protocols. Four, governmental regulatory reform, especially in health care, forcing industry wide shifts in how customers operate and buy. Five customers Efforts to expand operations globally, bringing new regional players to the table. Six, the simple fact that most solutions offered by suppliers today are purposefully designed to integrate more customer functions and tasks than ever before in order to provide customers higher impact, better value and improved ease of use. Seven new management styles and organizational structures leading to flatter, more networked organizations that place a premium on more frequent cross silo collaboration. Every one of these trends not only means more people involved in a typical purchase than ever before, but more important, more people across more roles who likely haven't been involved in the past. Of course, none of these trends is likely to reverse itself anytime soon. Bottom line, it's nearly impossible today to get a deal done without accounting for a seemingly vast array of budget owners, influencers and users. Third party consultants, you name it. But as the consensus story continues to evolve, the thing we find most troubling isn't the rise in number of people who have to buy in, but the equally dramatic increase in number of people who have to sign off. So unlike the consensus challenge of 2006, which largely centered around winning over a single senior decision maker and his or her team, today's consensus challenge has evolved into something far more complex. Today, whether suppliers are selling to a customer with 50 or 50,000 people, they rarely find that almost mythical senior decision maker able to individually approve a complex deal on behalf of all of their colleagues. Instead, more often than not, it's purchased by committee. It's collective consensus across a formal or informal group of senior employees, each with the ability to stop a deal if it fails to meet their particular needs or speak to their individual priorities. And that problem, we find, stretches well beyond just larger customers or more strategic accounts. Consensus challenges are just as likely to crop up in small and medium customers, where suppliers have traditionally been able to conduct most business through a single point of contact. As one sales leader in the food and beverage industry jokingly observed, even when we sell to mom and pops, we've got a mom and a pop, and they don't always see eye to eye. Small business isn't exempt from the consensus challenge. In fact, let's put some real numbers against this problem. In a survey of over 3000 stakeholders involved in a typical B2B purchase, we found that customers themselves report an average of 5.4 different people formally involved in a typical purchase decision. That's 5.4 opportunities for someone to say no. And that one simple number raises all sorts of questions for suppliers. Things like, do we even know who those 5.4 people are? For that matter, does our customer even know who those 5.4 people are? Sometimes they're not sure either. What does each of these individuals care about? How does our solution meet their individual needs? How do we win them over? The real trick in this new world of customer consensus is this isn't just 5.4 different people, it's 5.4 different perspectives. 3/4 of customer stakeholders we surveyed told us these 5.4 individuals span a wide variety of roles, teams, functions and geographies. And really this is the true challenge of consensus today. It's not so much that there are more people in a sale that makes things so hard. But that there are so many new perspectives. Every supplier has a version of this exact same story. For example, if you sell an IT solution, almost certainly you've traditionally called on the customers CIO and his or her team. But as most IT solutions today touch other parts of the business or more business decisions than ever before now feature a strong technological component. Now you're just as likely to also sell to CMO's, CEO's, or heads of HR, depending on who's using your system. Additionally, the broader scope and bigger footprint of your solution probably means you're also speaking with the CFO to procurement and maybe to regional presidents. Not to mention a whole range of end users, influencers, third party consultants and even potential partners. And lest we forget Legal, AKA the Sales Prevention Department. Indeed, one head of marketing in the healthcare industry recently told us for us it's not 5.4 people, but 5.4 committees of people. Bottom line, every supplier has their version of the same story, regardless of industry. We used to sell to X and now we sell to XYZ. As well as A, B and sometimes C. And everyone of them is different. Different priorities, different perspectives, different authority, even different levels of knowledge of what the supplier solution actually does in the first place and why that matters. That's the real challenge of customer consensus today. It isn't just a quantity problem. It's a diversity problem. Because when these groups come together to make a decision, almost inevitably it seems, things fall apart. The purchase likelihood drops dramatically as soon as a second decision maker is present. In a survey of 3000 customer stakeholders involved in a B2B purchase, we asked respondents the degree to which they agreed with the statement. We will definitely buy from this supplier in the next six months on a scale from 1:00 to 10:00. We tested other time horizons and got virtually the exact same result. Six months allowed us to capture the largest sample. We then map those responses according to total number of people on the buying team. Our data tells a dramatic story featuring two distinct downward inflection points. The first represents a rapid drop in purchase likelihood just by adding one more person to the purchase decision. So going from one to two people means overall likelihood to buy goes off a Cliff, dropping from 80% to the mid 50s. Indeed, apparently Mom and Pop don't always agree. Then things level off for a bit until we get past person #5. Then there's a second Cliff where likelihood to buy sinks like a stone to a dismal 30%. As a supplier selling to the 5.4, this is a hard graph to look at. From left to right, this is a one way ticket to indecision, with a final stop somewhere squarely in the center of what some sales leaders have come to call the solutions graveyard. From a research perspective, this finding proved hugely important, as it gave us the first indication in all our data that suppliers don't have nearly so much of A selling problem as perhaps they do a buying problem. Brought on largely by the new and wildly diverse cast of characters typically involved today in any Solutions purchase. For suppliers, however, that's a tough finding to digest as it's hard to know how to manage this kind of challenge. After all, customer diversity isn't something suppliers can make go away by telling their customer. Actually, we don't think your legal or procurement teams need to look this one over. For even if that attempt were to succeed in the short run, the long term consequences can be costly. As the chief sales officer at a global manufacturing company recently told us, we actually tried exactly that just last year, and it worked. We successfully cut everyone out of the purchase other than the head of operations and got the deal done in record time. The problem, he went on, was that when we then went to implement what we'd sold, all those people we'd previously caught out realized what was happening and completely overwhelmed the installation with objections and conflicts that we could have handled in advance if we just included them to begin with. In the end, he said, as hard as it may have been, we would have been far better off getting all those individuals on board as part of the purchase process because the bad will we generated as part of a rocky implementation not only undermine this deal, but likely cut us out of future deals for the foreseeable future. It's an incredibly tough thing to find out after it's too late to do anything about it. But it raises the questions If suppliers can't fully or even partially eliminate customer diversity as part of a sale, then how can they at least manage it more effectively? What's the best strategy for selling to increasingly diverse customer buying groups? Track them all down and win them all over. Around the world, the strategy for selling to diverse stakeholders follows the same frustrating reality. It requires a whole lot of work, and it requires a whole lot of time. In fact, most sales professionals agree the battle for customer consensus plays out across 2 dimensions, not just one. The first dimension is a challenge of access, simply winning the right to get in front of all the individuals who matter in the first place. And that's hard. With all those new people involved, the first step is figuring out who they all are in the first place. We encourage sellers to begin with the question, who are our 5.4 for this particular deal? It's a disarmingly simple question, but often surprisingly difficult to answer. In many cases, these aren't just new individuals, but new roles, functions, and maybe even geographies that that supplier has traditionally never called on before. And chances are pretty good that customers, stakeholders exact role in the purchase may be somewhat murky even to themselves. Beyond identifying them, however, is the more difficult task of winning. The right to speak with them, particularly as a seller may have little to no prior experience or existing connections to fall back on even in existing accounts with otherwise long standing relationships. What's worse, from the perspective of that target stakeholder, they may see no especially pressing need to talk to that supplier at all if they fail to see a relationship between their immediate concerns and the suppliers capabilities. Beyond winning access to each of these individuals, however, sellers still face the even greater challenge of winning each of them over ensuring they position their offering as precisely as possible so as to resonate with each stakeholders priorities and needs. And they have to do that 5.4 times, tracking them all down and then winning them all over. Now, one might argue, there's nothing new here. After all, that's nothing more than just plain good selling, same as it's been for years. But the real challenge is this is no longer a single sale, but a serial sale, each one a little different and carefully positioned to each stakeholder. To be sure, it is great selling, but it's great selling times 5.4. Checking off each stakeholder as they go, ensuring they've bought in before they move on to the next one. This one challenge has become the heart and soul of most sales managers checking calls with their team. So who have you called on so far? How did it go? Are they on board? How do you know? OK, who's next? How are you going to get in front of them? How are you going to position things for them? How do you think they'll react? What objections do you think they might have? Insert role play? OK, who's left after that? So reps work from the known to the less known, the familiar to the less familiar, slowly building consensus step by step as they seek to collect a yes from each of those conversations. A tenured sales manager we interviewed memorably compared it to the plate spinning act at the circus. You get the first plate spinning on the stick and then move on to the second. You get the second one spinning and move to the third, but somewhere along the line the first plate has started to wobble, so you have to go back and get it under control as you're simultaneously trying to move on to the 4th. And so it goes across the board, winning one stakeholder at a time. Check, check and check. But the deeper into the 5.4 we go, the harder these conversations become. In an all too common but still deeply painful scenario, the head of sales at a company that sells highly technical instruments for the manufacturing sector told us that his sales reps are almost exclusively trained engineers, which has always made sense in the past as they've traditionally called on engineers inside the customer organization. However, across the last five years, as the scope, impact and expense of their newer solutions have expanded, they can now rarely get a deal done without also speaking with the customer's head of finance. The problem is their reps have never sold to CFO's before and find them completely intimidating, so they avoid calling them altogether. But what do you do when your own Salesforce is literally too scared to call your customer? At first glance it might sound somewhat absurd, but this happens all over the world every single day. This is what happens when sellers move into the world of the 5.4. Sales reps familiar comfort zone of selling doesn't expand nearly as fast as customers required. Consensus zone for buying. Likewise, parallel efforts in marketing don't fare much better. A recent move in B2B marketing towards something known as B2P or business to people marketing arises in part from this exact same trend. There, the thinking goes, even in the world of business to business buying, it's not companies that buy things, but people that do. And with the rapid increase in both number and diversity of people involved in a typical purchase, suppliers have to understand those people today far better and get in front of them far earlier than ever before, with content and campaigns that will more specifically speak to each of their unique needs and priorities. In many ways, it's the marketing analog to the track them all down and win them all over sales strategy. So not surprisingly then, we've observed a strong and renewed interest among more advanced marketing teams in building ever more accurate customer personas, trying to understand individual buyers and their needs. Simultaneously, we've watched marketing organizations dedicate increasing amounts of time and money to building more targeted content designed to speak to very specific members of the 5.4 about the issues they care about most at each stage of the purchase journey. Given the scope of the challenge, however, these same teams, often made-up of only a handful of people, become easily overwhelmed trying to place highly personalized original content in all the right places at all the right times for all the right people involved in a typical purchase process. Even then, there is often little concrete evidence to show that any of this effort translates into real commercial outcomes, leaving marketers to point to intermediate measures like increased click through rates or more likes on the company Facebook page to justify the added time and expense of their effort. When we put it together, it's no wonder that commercial leaders around the world complain of increased cost of sale, longer cycle times, stall deals and smaller deal sizes. The ongoing battle of tracking down each of the 5.4 and then successfully winning each of them over not only takes a huge amount of time and effort, it's fraught with challenge every step of the way. And it leaves commercial leaders around the world thinking the same thing. As one head of sales and marketing put it to us rather poignantly, there's got to be a better way. All this customer consensus is killing our business. But what could that better answer be? In search of answers. Given this strong pressure on performance, the CEB sales and marketing practice recently set out to study the dynamics of customer consensus in far greater depth than we ever had in the past. At the center of this work was an effort to supplement the vast amount of customer research we'd already conducted in the past with new data aimed at group buying dynamics. And much of that data came from a survey of 1000 people all involved in some fashion in a typical B to B purchase, representing a wide range of both industries and geographies. More than anything else, the survey was designed to shed new light on the complex relationship across group buying behaviors, commercial outcomes, purchase attributes and sales Rep behavior. The story that arose from all that work is fascinating as upon first glance, it is deeply counterintuitive. In fact, when we first ran our analysis, we weren't sure whether we should believe the result. We went back and reran the numbers, remodeled the data, rechecked the sample in an effort to undo a finding that we initially found very difficult to believe. But the findings proved incredibly robust. Though those findings didn't seem to make a lot of sense when we first saw them, as we dug deeper into the data and continued to dissect the challenge it was meant to address, we came to the conclusion that we've been thinking about the consensus problem in exactly the wrong way, the implications for sales and marketing. We're huge. An unexpected finding? To show you what we mean, let's start with a concept we'll call a high quality sale, which serves as the backbone for much of our consensus work. The idea here is suppliers aren't looking to close just any business, they're looking to close good business. So while it is true that suppliers lose to status quo far more often than they'd like, it is equally true that even when they win, they often don't win the way they'd hoped. Perhaps the customer bought a much smaller, good enough version of their solution. Or maybe the customers so completely beat them up on price that the deal came in way below target margins? So technically we might call those deals wins, but they're hollow victories at best. We hear this all the time from commercial leaders. It's not so much the low quantity of deals they're doing that causes the real pain, but the low quality of the deals that are ultimately sold. So when we talk about a high quality sale in our data, what we're trying to capture is the kind of deal where customers buy the bigger solution at a higher margin. In our study, we defined a quality sale as a deal where customers number one did not settle for a less ambitious solution, but number two purchased a premium offering relative to the base offering. We tested for those attributes through a number of different questions across our various survey instruments. So now the question becomes, how does suppliers win that kind of high quality deal, especially in a 5.4 world? Well, let's go back to our strategy for selling to diversity in the first place and see what happens. You'll remember the conventional sales and marketing approach in the 5.4 world is we have to track them all down and then win them all over. When we ran the various commercial activities associated with that approach through our model, we found something rather shocking. When we measured each of those two approaches, IE winning access or tracking them all down and then better individual positioning or winning them all over against the probability of winning a high quality sale, we found that winning access to key stakeholders boosts that probability by a positive 4%. But positioning our offering to resonate more strongly with each stakeholder actually reduces that probability by 4%. Now, what do those numbers mean? Let's take them one at a time. The way to interpret the access number, for example is this. If we were to move from below average performance to above average performance on winning access to each stakeholder across the 5.4, we'd be 4% more likely to close a high quality deal. In other words, access matters. It has a statistically significant impact on driving up deal quality. Though you'd likely agree, it doesn't appear to matter nearly as much as anyone might have thought. After all, a 4% increase doesn't seem to be all that meaningful. That's kind of strange. But even stranger is our finding for Tactic #2. This is about winning over each stakeholder one at a time by connecting our offer as strongly as possible to whatever they care about the most. So we position our offer to meet their needs, emphasizing our ability to address their specific priorities, speak to their individual view of what's important, and connect directly to what they've got to get done, IE their MB, O's, personal projects, etc. And the impact here is actually negative. Now what does that mean? Well, what it means is that the better we get at customizing our offer at the individual level, the less likely we are to close a high quality deal. Effectively personalizing our offer to each stakeholder decreases deal quality, pushing us deeper into the very commodity trap we were hoping to avoid by personalizing in the first place. In fact, when we dig into the data one level deeper, we find that if we move from below average performance to above average performance on personalization, we're 20% more likely to have a negative impact on overall deal quality. In other words, the better one positions the offer to the individual, the more likely there is to be a negative impact on overall deal quality. It doesn't seem to make any sense. We can tell you our first reaction to these results was a whole lot of surprise mixed with more than just a little bit of concern. After all, we're the challenger guys, the group who found that the best reps are defined by their ability to teach, tailor, and take control. And yet this data seems to indicate that tailoring can actually hurt you. So we stared at this for a really long time, trying to figure out what was going on. But it wasn't until we saw the rest of the story, which we'll turn to next, that we figured out what's going on here. And when you see it, you'll find that this result makes a lot of sense. In fact, you'll likely be as surprised as we were that it wasn't more obvious all along. But before we go there, we first offer one crucial note to provide some important context to our earlier work. Rest assured, today is not the day we disavow ourselves of the Challenger findings and apologetically declare that we got it wrong the first time around. As you'll see, as we continue to work through all of our findings in the world of the 5.4, a challenger approach replete with effective tailoring is arguably more important than ever before. That said, at the same time, these findings have also led us to realize that we must be far more precise about what we mean by tailoring and how we go about it, in order not to inadvertently do damage where we sought to do good. For, the data is indeed very clear. Tailoring done the wrong way can have a significantly chilling effect on overall deal quality. Our traditional sales approach of gaining access and then making our pitch 5.4 times is insufficient to drive commercial growth. Yet that's exactly what most sales and marketing organizations are doing right now, all with the very best of intentions of pursuing a commercial strategy that, frankly, at first blush, seems inescapably logical. So what exactly is going on here? Well, remember, all of this research was conducted within a very specific context, not of selling behavior, but of buying behavior. Even more specifically, group buying behavior. Because what we're ultimately trying to figure out isn't how suppliers can sell effectively to individuals, but rather how they can sell more effectively to groups of individuals. And even more important, diverse groups of individuals. What we found is more than anything else, it's the diversity of these groups that makes all the difference. If there is one finding in all of our consensus work that stands above all others, it is that selling to individuals and selling to groups of diverse individuals is not the same thing. But not because the selling is different. Rather, because the buying is different. Solving for the right problem. You'll remember, the core tenet of marketers push toward B2P marketing, including more personalized content and messaging, is the broad recognition that at the end of the day, it's not companies that buy things, but people that do. And if we don't understand and connect to those people better than ever before, we'll fail to win them over. However, based on all of our research, what we've come to conclude is this. While it may be true that even in business settings it's not companies that buy things, but people that do, in today's B to B environment, it is equally true that it's not people that buy things, but groups of them that do. If we don't understand how these groups of people work together, if we sell only at the individual level and not simultaneously at the collective level, there's a good chance we'll miss what has become the most important dynamic in B to B selling today. Finding a way to connect the diverse individuals that comprise a buying group around a higher level vision than where they're most likely to land on their own. Why is that? There's a very good reason and it shows up right in the data. If we map the relationship between stakeholder diversity and something we've come to call stakeholder dysfunction, we find the relationship between the two to be very telling. Let's start with a couple of definitions. First, stakeholder diversity is based on the range of different functions, roles, teams, geographies, and divergent priorities represented across the various stakeholders directly involved in the purchase decision. Stakeholder dysfunction, on the other hand. Captures the degree to which members of that buying group struggle to effectively collaborate across a number of important dimensions. More specifically, for the purposes of this work, stakeholder dysfunction goes up when one's various stakeholders don't have a fair say in Group discussion. Two stakeholders avoid discussions of the most important issues regarding a purchase altogether. Three stakeholders outright disagree with one another multiple times regarding purchase details. These are all things that can be measured quantitatively by asking survey respondents a series of questions regarding how they collaborated with other members of the buying group. And really, this is pretty familiar stuff. If you think about a group purchase you've been involved in recently, you'll undoubtedly see some of your own experience in at least one or two of those attributes. Think for example about the most recent purchase of a new CRM solution in your organization and how that played out. So let's look at the relationship between these two things, diversity and dysfunction. The data is very clear. As stakeholder diversity increases, so does dysfunction. Pretty dramatically, in fact. Or put another way, as the diversity of the various stakeholders that suppliers find themselves selling to continues to expand, they can expect to see an equally dramatic rise in the dysfunction of the groups comprised of those increasingly diverse individuals. This all makes a ton of sense. There are all sorts of reasons why more diverse groups struggle to function effectively. If someone is working with a group of colleagues across their company, all representing different, sometimes even competing, perspectives and priorities, it's almost inevitable that they're going to disagree with at least someone. Not personally, but almost certainly professionally, as everyone is working toward whatever priorities make the most sense for their part of the business. In that environment, there are all sorts of reasons why individuals might fail to connect as that group deliberates. We all have a tendency to think very carefully about the cost benefit, trade-offs of different kinds and levels of group engagement. I don't want to share my opinion or advocate too strongly for my position. It's too hard. They won't get it. It's a lot of work for very little benefit. It's just not worth it. Or perhaps. I won't speak up because I don't wanna look dumb or selfish or too dominant or too weak or sound too much like I'm not a team player. On the other hand, other individuals might push too hard, seeking to win over the group by sheer force of will or rhetoric or even volume, failing to understand the very different perspectives around them. Achieving group consensus in an environment like that can be extremely difficult. Overtime everyone loses patience and maybe even gives up. Actually, when we think of it that way, it's a wonder that groups can agree on anything at all. That said, things don't necessarily have to be this way. When it comes to effectively creating customer consensus, the data provides a ray of hope as well. For just because diversity and dysfunction are highly correlated doesn't mean that they have to always be intertwined. In the end, suppliers may not have an uncontrollable diversity problem so much as they have an addressable dysfunction problem. Unlike customer diversity, which is largely out of suppliers control, customer dysfunction is something they can do something about, but probably not very well given conventional sales and marketing strategy. Because imagine how the track them all down and win them all over approach plays out in this world of high customer dysfunction. It does nothing to solve for the problem because this is a problem it was never designed to solve. Current sales and marketing tactics are designed to do something completely different. They are far more focused on better connecting individual customers, stakeholders to the supplier than they are on better connecting those same individual customer stakeholders to each other. To shed light on just how poorly suppliers Old World Commercial Approach is designed to solve for customers New World Buying dysfunction, let's take a closer look at what these buying groups are struggling to agree on in the first place. Because, as it turns out, the most common source of customer dysfunction has nothing to do with the supplier in the first place. Climbing the ME to We mountain. If we think about the various stages customer stakeholders must pass through to move a purchase forward at a high level we can narrow it down to three in particular, each crucially important. One problem definition. Two solution identification. 3 supplier selection. At any one of those points, things can go off the rails pretty badly as relevant customer stakeholders potentially fail to reach agreement. So as a hypothetical example, let's say a company has recognized they're unable to make effective strategic decisions due to their lack of quality data-driven insight. So what to do? Well, first that team has to reach agreement on what exactly the underlying problem is in the first place. Is a data quality data quantity. Data gathering. Analysis capabilities. Or maybe they have all the data they need, but it's trapped in various legacy systems that don't effectively communicate with one another. Whatever the case, that buying group has to first define the problem it's trying to solve. That said, once they've reached agreement on the problem, there's still the question of what to do about it. So let's say for example, they've settled on a data analysis problem. Now how to solve for better data analysis? Well, there are all sorts of approaches one might take there, ranging from something relatively straightforward like buying better analytical software, to giving staff the tools they need to study and play with the data in new ways, all the way to investing in training and development to give them the skills they need. To perform more sophisticated analysis. Of course, across that very broad spectrum of possible solutions, there are myriad other options, ranging from less expensive and disruptive to extremely so. Without agreement on a course of action, however, that deal isn't going anywhere. So for the sake of argument, let's say that that team has identified a solution that they can all agree on. Maybe it's the purchase of a new suite of analytical tools. The next step would be to shop that solution with various vendors in order to determine which one can best meet their needs and then eventually select the one that everyone can agree on. Now, admittedly, any given solutions purchase is far more complicated and far less linear than this. But it's an instructive abstraction nonetheless, as it allows us to measure the relative difficulty of each of these decision nodes across a typical purchase process. What we wanted to figure out in this analysis, in the unforgettable words of a senior manager at a business services company, was At what point across that continuum does the wailing and mashing of teeth reach a crescendo inside the customer company, exposing that deal to the greatest amount of potentially insurmountable customer dysfunction? Or put in a far less colorful way, when that purchase is most likely to fail. Now to figure that out, we asked respondents, as part of a much larger survey of 3000 customer stakeholders involved in a B2B purchase, to rate each of these three critical moments in terms of their relative difficulty, both with respect to reaching an individual or me decision. And in terms of achieving collective agreement or a wee decision? The first thing we find in our analysis is a much better understanding of just how much harder group decisions are than individual ones. Across the board, at each of those three decision points, the group decision, the wee moment proved dramatically harder than the individual decision, the Me moment. In fact, we can quantify the difference. On average, group decisions are nearly twice as hard as individual ones. If you think about any major purchase you've been a part of in your own organization, we'd imagine this finding will ring true. This is the price we pay for diverse buying groups. That said, the far more interesting output of this analysis is a clear indication that not all we moments are created equal. One in particular stands out as especially difficult, and that's solution identification. So while customers, stakeholders might all agree they have a problem, the data and common experience tells us there's likely going to be some pretty significant debate on the best way to solve that problem. This is a hugely valuable thing for us to know. Because it tells us that if suppliers are going to focus time and effort on creating customer consensus, the place where they really need to rally agreement is around the specific solution to the customers problem, irrespective of supplier. Now, by the same token, the analysis also tells us the thing least likely to create disagreement among stakeholders is supplier selection. Why is that? Largely because by the time the group has coalesced around a well defined high priority problem and an agreed upon clear course of action in many cases. From that point forward the biggest question left to address is simply which of any number of possible suppliers can deliver a well aligned solution. At a relatively reasonable price. Welcome back to the 103 problem. But if that's the case, then this data also tells us something about what most sellers and marketers are likely doing right now to win customer consensus, if they're doing anything at all. Because traditionally speaking, if there's one thing all suppliers are trying to get their customer stakeholders to agree on, it's that their company is great. That they're the best, that they're the leading provider of whatever solution that customer is already looking for. In most cases, that message sounds something like this. Our company is a leading customer focused global provider of innovative solutions supported by cutting edge innovations designed to empower organizations with different in kind sources of broad based value creation at their most critical moments of need. And oh, by the way, we're green. Sound familiar? If there was one thing we'd all want customers to agree on, surely that would be it. That we're the market leader, the leading brand, the best possible partner that we can not only meet their needs, but exceed them. So that's the thing all suppliers focus on. But what this data tells us is if that's the focus of suppliers consensus building efforts, then they're solving for only one of three possible consensus failure points across a purchase path. And of those three, they're almost exclusively focused on the least difficult for customers to agree upon. Not the most. At the same time, those same suppliers are leaving customers on their own to achieve agreement around the two points where things tend to fall apart. So if a purchase decision is going to stall, more likely than not, it's going to stall far earlier than most suppliers would anticipate. Particularly if they're focused only on watching for signs of customer disagreement around the value of their offering. As much as leaders tell us they want their reps to get in earlier, this data tells us pretty emphatically that if they do indeed manage to get in earlier, they need to take that opportunity to help customers overcome the challenge they're facing earlier. And that challenge has little to do with choosing A supplier and everything to do with deciding which problems are worth solving in the first place and what solutions are worth pursuing to solve them all, irrespective of supplier. This is why the Challenger approach proves so effective, as that's exactly what it's designed to do. To give you a sense of just how painful this kind of misalignment can be, the CMO at a medical equipment company told us the following story when he saw this data. Historically, his company has sold to surgeons who would debate the merits of their product versus those of the competition. It was a straight up battle over who had the superior capability. But today, when they call on those same hospitals, they find they're no longer sitting at the table with just the surgeon, but with a diverse group of buyers comprised of the chief surgeon, the CFO, the head of procurement and various hospital administrators. So now, instead of debating which suppliers medical equipment to buy, this incredibly diverse buying group is deliberating whether they should buy any more medical equipment at all, or take that money and build a new parking garage as an additional revenue stream for the hospital. This is what happens when diverse groups get together. Dysfunction almost naturally follows as not only perspectives but priorities become highly divergent. But more likely than not, it's not even dysfunction or disagreement around which supplier to select, but rather around which problem to address in the first place and how to address it. It's a painful story, but indicative of how misaligned most suppliers are today in helping customers overcome arguably the number one obstacle in buying their solution. Counterintuitively, suppliers biggest challenge in winning customer consensus has nothing to do with that suppliers solution at all. Even more troubling, much of the customer's primary consensus challenge occurs far before most sellers are even present to address it in the first place. Mind the gap from 37 to 57. In a well documented study, see The End of Solution Sales, Harvard Business Review, July to August 2012. The CEB team asked customer stakeholders to consider a typical B to be purchase process from beginning to end and then identify the point at which their organization typically reaches out to a supplier to seek their advice. That answer came back as 57%. On average, customers are 57% of the way through a typical purchase process prior to proactively reaching out to a supplier sales Rep for their direct input on whatever it is that they're doing. For suppliers evolving to complex solutions, our data also tells us that the more complex the deal, the later the customer contact. Why? Likely because customers looking to make large investments in a complex solution want to be extra sure they've done sufficient due diligence to avoid being unduly swayed by a particularly charismatic sales Rep accompanied by an especially knowledgeable sales technician bent on pedaling a general supplier solution. Rather than addressing a specific customer need. Now that 57% number has huge implications for suppliers. If we consider what's likely happening inside that 57%, chances are pretty good that customers are now doing on their own most of the things that suppliers were hoping to do with them together. They're identifying a need. They're prioritizing that need relative to others. They're determining which capabilities they'll require to address that need. They're identifying which suppliers are best able to deliver that capability. In most cases, they're conducting preliminary research on how much each of those suppliers cost. So by the time a supplier is called in at that 57% mark, more often than not there's little left to discuss but price. As one senior leader memorably put it. That 57% is a freight train to RFP station. And we're on it. Still more troubling, however, is what happens when we place that 57% number into the context of customer consensus. Because in follow-up research, we also ask customers to identify the point in a purchase process at which internal conflict most likely reaches a peak. Or the wailing and mashing of teeth hits a crescendo, and that deal is in the greatest danger of falling apart altogether. And that number came back as 37%. Group conflict peaks at 37%. That's the summit of the Me to We Mountain, where that deal is most likely to die. And you'll remember that peak centers around solution identification, not supplier selection. A problem most suppliers infrequently address. But let's consider what happens when we put these two numbers together. If a purchase decision is most likely to stall at 37%, but a supplier sales Rep isn't likely to be called in until 57%, then the resulting gap between the two raises a very practical and pretty troubling question. How many times have suppliers lost a deal that they never even knew was in play to begin with as the customer couldn't make it past the 37% mark on their own? Or more simply, how many times have sellers lost before they could ever attempt to win? The answer, of course, is unknowable, though deeply disquieting nonetheless. For in that gap, from 37% to 57% is a trail littered with deals that have been left to die. Among the dried up markers, leftover takeout food and haphazard piles of double sided PowerPoints strewn across the floor of customer conference rooms around the world. All bearing witness to the five point fours inability to reach collective agreement. That gap has hugely important implications for suppliers. Traditionally, most commercial organizations have considered customer consensus to be primarily a sales challenge, requiring reps to win broad customer agreement on the ground, one person at a time. But if suppliers are largely relying upon sales to stitch together collective consensus once they're called in, then the data tells us they're missing a crucial part of the problem. Customer consensus isn't a sales challenge, it is a commercial challenge. To be sure, there are a number of things sales reps can and must do to crack open the 57% and win earlier access to customer deliberations. But in many cases, if suppliers are doing nothing to simultaneously address the consensus problem earlier through marketing, then there's a good chance that that deal can die before sales ever wins Sufficient access to get a chance to even try. This challenge must be attacked from both directions simultaneously. For marketing, part, far beyond battling for individual residents through more personalized campaigns and content be to be marketers are going to have to find ways to anticipate customer disconnects far earlier in the purchase process and avert them proactively. For left unaddressed, these disconnects can be devastating to the suppliers bottom line. Fighting the lowest common denominator. When we put it all together, we find the far bigger challenge for suppliers isn't improving their own abilities to sell. It's addressing the customers inability to agree. To understand what's going on here, let's introduce a concept called a mental model. Now, we'll examine mental models in a significant amount of depth later. But for now, to keep things simple, think of a mental model simply as the way an individual understands their world and how it works. We represent these mental models with three overlapping circles in the form of a Venn diagram. So these might be three different individuals in different roles, functions or geographies. For each mental model, each stakeholder will have their own goals, priorities, means, and metrics, all unique to their particular perspective. This is the source of dysfunction. It's not these stakeholders different backgrounds per se, but the fact that those different backgrounds bring with them different, even divergent, mental models. Of course, if a supplier must target 5.4 stakeholders, that potential divergence becomes that much worse. It's a very simple concept, but that's on purpose because a simple concept like this allows us to visualize very clearly just what suppliers are up against in creating broad based customer consensus around a high quality deal. That's because the question we can now ask when looking at a diagram like this is. Just how much overlap is there across the different mental models of the various stakeholders that we have to connect? Really, that's the question that matters most, because that overlap is the single point of agreement across all those stakeholders mental models. It's where they connect. Where they agree. And if that overlap is very small, then that group can agree on only very little. So, left to their own devices, various stakeholders come together to consider a purchase. And if they find few shared priorities or little common ground for mutual understanding, they settle on the lowest common denominator where they're most likely to agree. Things like avoid risk, move cautiously, reduce disruption and save money. Every supplier knows all too well what it feels like to be on the receiving end of that kind of customer consensus. This is dysfunction. And this is what it gets us. It's not that diverse customer buying groups can't agree on anything. It's just that left to their own devices, they can't agree on very much and will rarely agree on anything that is highly disruptive or ambitious. If we think about what all of this means for suppliers, what this tells us is as they move into a world of increasing stakeholder diversity, suppliers are simultaneously moving into a world of increasing stakeholder dysfunction brought on by decreasing overlap in their mental models. As the little overlapping triangle at the center of that Venn diagram continues to shrink, it's no wonder that suppliers are all competing with status quo small deals and low margins. That's the one thing left in common among an otherwise divergent and dysfunctional group of diverse decision makers. This is the commodity trap suppliers struggle to escape every single day that sits at the core of the one of three problem. And otherwise dysfunctional group of customer stakeholders, unable to agree on a common vision but forced to agree on something, is likely to agree on doing nothing. Or at least doing as little as possible in order to find common ground. We can see this phenomenon in the data as well. A Dysfunctional group is a full 50% less likely to pay a premium for a high cost offering than a functional group. If we think back to where we started with suppliers, common approach for creating customer consensus and play it out in this world, we're now in a much better position to understand the findings we saw earlier. As we consider the Track them Down and Win Them Over approach, you'll remember we found that while winning Greater Stakeholder Access may help. More careful positioning of one's offering to each stakeholders needs actually hurts us, at least in terms of driving high quality deals. And that finding was really counterintuitive. But now, using a Venn diagram like the one we described, we can see exactly why that's the case. If we think about aligning our supplier value proposition more closely to each stakeholders mental model, insofar as those models are divergent to begin with, then they're making things worse, not better. They're exacerbating the very separation that keeps this group from agreeing on anything but the most basic common ground in the first place. At the end of the day, suppliers, traditional sales and marketing efforts have likely emphasized difference rather than overcome it. Underscoring individual separation rather than reinforcing mutual connection. What's fascinating about all this is that these findings shed light on one of the most frustrating phenomena in complex sales today. Watching a deal wither on the vine, despite the fact that a supplier has managed to successfully secure the support of each and every stakeholder who seems to matter most. We see it all the time. All the time. Marketing's personalized content brings in a lead the first person out of the 5.4. The sales team picks it up and engages that first person who expressed interest. And then proceeds to track down each and every member of the 5.4 until they have successfully won them all over. One by one. Everything seems to be in place. Then somehow, at the last minute, after every stakeholder has said yes. The deal inexplicably falls apart. Or at the very least, it shrunk down to a much smaller size at a far lower price than what was originally proposed. The seller is left wondering what in the world just happened. We had it in the palm of our hand and then it all just sort of slipped away. As one sales leader put it more often than I care to admit, we live in a world where each person says yes, but then the group ultimately says no. It's like I live in a world where 1 + 1 + 1. Equals 0. How is that even possible? Well, using the mental model construct, we can now understand exactly how that might be possible. There are a number of different versions of the same story, but one reason that deal may still fall apart is the fact that in winning over each stakeholder, the seller specifically highlighted those components or parts of their offering that spoke most directly to each individual's needs. And why wouldn't they? After all, they were likely trained to do exactly that. But think about how that approach plays out across a dysfunctional group. If the seller personalizes the offering so much, then when each of the 5.4 comes together to compare notes, they find that the proposed deal is far bigger, far more disruptive, and far more expensive than anything anyone individual thought they were signing up for. And then that group will naturally scope it back down to an acceptable size. If the supplier has done nothing to overcome their divergent mental models, helping them better appreciate the important connections across their otherwise disparate decision making criteria, then that deal is almost certainly destined for the dustbin, or at least some significant downsizing to something mutually agreeable to everyone. Bottom line, if suppliers don't create convergence, their customers will. If it turns out that the only thing those customers can agree on is to do nothing, then at the end of the day that's exactly what they're going to do. But notice that supplier lost not because they failed to connect individual stakeholders to them, but rather because they overlooked the fact that those same stakeholders weren't necessarily very well connected to each other. And that's how 1 + 1 + 1 = 0. The supplier collects a yes from each individual, but still gets a collective know from the customer. Because it turns out there's a vast difference between a collection of Yeses and a collective yes. So can suppliers get to a collective? Yes. Absolutely. That's what this book is all about. But building that bridge from me to we will take a very specific strategy targeted to a very special stakeholder. From Me to we. To show you what we mean, let's think of a typical customer purchase process as moving through three distinct phases. In phase one, we begin with the customer in a state of status quo. Then, through the recognition of some particular need, or perhaps through the exposure to an insight provided by a supplier, at least one or two of the stakeholders in that customer organization come to realize that change is necessary. Indeed it is in this first movement from phase one to phase two where demand is born as this is where high performing sales reps who we've dubbed challengers approach the customer armed with powerful insight to challenge the way they think about their Business Research that we've documented extensively in. The Challenger sale. Specifically, in this first movement, tailoring one's content and approach is crucial to win these individuals over in the first place. For done well, these stakeholders land in phase two, which is individual willingness to explore alternate course of action. The idea here is that someone inside the customer organization has recognized that they have a clear need worth addressing and they have committed to exploring it further. Of course, the degree to which the supplier has skewed that vision in their favor is critical. This is where we left things at the conclusion of the Challenger sale in phase two, with a number of customer stakeholders excited about a new idea and what it could mean for their company. However, despite the hard won individual buy in a supplier may have achieved in phase two, that potential purchase is still a long way off from an actual closed deal as that insight now has to traverse along second journey from phase two to phase three, which may or may not land in Group agreement around an actual purchase decision. It is across this second movement where individual support must somehow evolve into group consensus, moving from me to we as the supplier works with that stakeholder to build a bridge to the other 4.4. This can be a tough road to hoe because it is here that the supplier has to bring in the other stakeholders, get them to meet, convince them to agree and win them over. Procurements. Gotta get involved. Finance has to approve. Legal has to look things over. This is why the distance from phase two to three is so much longer than the distance from one to two. One member joked. This is where good deals go to die. It is indeed the Solutions graveyard. But it is also here where the sellers tailoring strategy must morph into something else entirely, tailoring for group consensus rather than tailoring for individual buy in. For if we think about the best way to build that bridge from me to we landing in a collective, yes, at some point in this process, the supplier will have to transition pretty sharply from connecting individual stakeholders to them and start connecting those same stakeholders to each other. Yet many of these deliberations and conversations are most likely to happen behind closed doors and over the horizon, well beyond the direct influence of an individual seller. So influencing these conversations can be incredibly difficult. Harder still, there's no indication in any of our research that individual stakeholders are created equal in their ability to influence those discussions when the seller can't be there to do it directly. Despite their common support for a particular course of action, in other words, not all customer stakeholders are equally able or even willing to fight the good fight of winning over the other 4.4 at the same time. Quite the contrary, in fact. This is where star sellers make a critical choice for, it turns out, the specific individual they seek out to help them build that collective yes, truly matters, arguably as much as any other decision they make in driving that deal. For without the right partner inside the customer organization, they'll likely fail to build a bridge from me to we able to sustain anything more than the most watered down of deals. So who do they choose? That's where we turn next. But lest you think you can skip the next chapter if you're in marketing, listen on, as the story you're about to hear will have hugely important implications for the entire commercial organization, both sales Rep skill and marketing capability.\n",
      "Chapter 3. The art of unteaching.  If there is one simple truth of every B to B supplier today, it is that they're all selling the same thing. Change. Whether it's convincing customers to buy from them instead of the competition to outsource to them what they've traditionally done on their own, or perhaps to upgrade to their newer, broader solution instead of maintaining their older, smaller one. One way or another, virtually every solution sale revolves around a suppliers attempt to convince customers to change. But think about what that means. What's the one thing most organizations would like to avoid at all costs unless they have absolutely no other choice? Change. Why? It's expensive. It's risky, it's disruptive, It's unknown. Indeed, the one thing all suppliers are selling is exactly the same thing most customers are actively avoiding. From that perspective, it's no wonder that solution selling is so hard. Or for that matter, that most suppliers single biggest competitor today isn't so much the competition, but the customer's own status quo. But if we consider the challenge of selling change within the context of creating customer consensus, we begin to see how monumentally difficult selling solutions truly has become. For as hard as it is to convince a single senior buyer that whatever they're currently doing isn't good enough, how in the world does a supplier successfully convince a diverse group of 5.4 stakeholders of the exact same thing? Especially when the end result will require some kind of organizational change that some if not all, would prefer to avoid if at all possible. Remember, if the 5.4 is naturally predisposed to agree on anything, more likely than not it's to avoid risk, move cautiously, reduce disruption, and save money. How is a supplier supposed to overcome that kind of broad based resistance to change? Mobilizing the mobilizer. When we think of it like this, it's no wonder that Star performing sales reps seek out mobilizers. After all, they're the individuals inside the customer organization most open to change in the first place. They're looking for new ideas, willing to consider alternate courses of action, and, crucially, able to win over others. Buy into that alternate point of view. That's not to say, of course, that mobilizers are necessarily looking for a supplier, or even less likely, a particular supplier. But they are at least grudgingly at times, willing to entertain a conversation with a supplier should they believe the supplier might have something worthwhile to share. Simply put, star performers, recognizing that they first and foremost sell change, very carefully target those individuals most open or least resistant to that change in the first place, and then lean on those individuals to drive that change elsewhere across the organization. One sales executive called it the New Physics of sales. Mobilizers, she told us, allow me to minimize inertia and maximize momentum. That said, if we think back to the three-step model of a customer purchase we introduced in Chapter one, those physics will play out in different ways at different points across the purchase process. From phase one to phase 2A, supplier must first convince someone inside the customer organization that change is even necessary. Remember, the goal isn't so much to convince someone to buy a solution, but rather to persuade them to change their behavior. Just because someone might be predisposed to favor change in general doesn't necessarily mean that they'll be willing to support the specific change advocated by a given supplier. So the way that Supplier's message is constructed, the way it's designed to make the case for change, really matters. As one head of sales told us. Look, I might be a mobilizer, but that doesn't mean I'm going to mobilize around every new idea put on the table. Context really matters. And he's right. Setting a mobilizer in motion across that first shift from phase one to phase two requires A convincing vision and credible evidence that that change is even worth it in the first place. Still, that's just the beginning. For, just because the mobilizer is open to change doesn't necessarily mean any of the other 4.4 are at all. That mobilizer now faces a real uphill battle building a bridge from me to we across the chasm from phase two to phase three. And the support suppliers provide in that effort can make all the difference in whether the mobilizer is both willing and able to successfully champion change across the rest of that buying group. Now, just to make things even harder, none of this happens in a vacuum. You'll remember CEB customer research has additionally found that customers are contacting supplier sales reps later than ever before across a typical purchase process. That's the 57% we reviewed earlier. Customers proactively seek out sales Rep input at 57% of the way through a purchase. That single statistic renders this entire three phase process significantly much more difficult. For just because sales reps aren't necessarily there to see it happen doesn't mean it doesn't have to happen nonetheless. Just the opposite. It means customers are now left to figure it out on their own. Now there are a number of things sellers can do to regain access to the earlier part of a purchase. We'll look at one idea in particular, social selling later. From a suppliers point of view, at the very least the 57% number tells us that much of the identification and motivation of a mobilizer may not happen through person to person sales interactions at all. But rather through broader based marketing channels designed to connect with customers far earlier. The lesson being, without tight integration between sales and marketing, it's unlikely A supplier can predictably influence any of this change process at all. But let's consider for a moment why customers are delaying contact with sales reps for as long as they are. The answer is simple, but rather instructive. Because they can. In fact, based on all of our research, we've come to postulate a sort of golden rule of customer supplier engagement. Left to their own devices, customers will always engage a supplier as late as they possibly can. In other words, much of the reason why a customer engages A supplier 57% of the way through the purchase rather than earlier, is that they don't believe that the supplier has anything valuable to contribute to the conversation. At least nothing. They couldn't get off that suppliers website on their own without having to speak with a sales Rep. So if I reach out to a supplier, the thinking goes all they're going to do is drone on about their product or service and ask me lots of open-ended questions that I don't need their help answering. It's biased information, and it's never really about helping my business so much as selling theirs. Who wants to sit through that? In a world of information accessibility, customers can get all of that on the Internet. Talking directly to a supplier feels like a waste of time. Let's face it, many of us listening to this book sell for a living, and we likely feel exactly the same way about people who sell to us. Why talk to a salesperson unless you really think you have to? That's exactly where teaching comes in, convincingly proving to customers and especially mobilizers that they do have to talk to you. But now we can better appreciate the very specific and rather complicated context within which we must deploy that teaching. In this world, suppliers teaching must one capture the attention of a mobilizer in a way that two motivates them to champion a change in behavior, leading them to three rally the support of the other 4.4 around a vision that four. Leads that customer back to their unique solution. That's a very high bar indeed. In fact, we have a name for this very special kind of content. We call it Commercial Insight. The reason we find commercial insights so powerful is that it's the only kind of teaching we've found in all of our research that can impact customer buying behavior across all three stages of that buying process, irrespective of where it's deployed. Whether it's winning, the willingness of individual stakeholders to mobilize in the first place, or equipping those mobilizers to win over the other 4.4 who are potentially even less inclined to change. That's because Commercial insight is designed to change what customers are currently thinking, regardless of what that thinking might be, whether it's to do something different or just as likely to do nothing at all. In a world where every supplier is selling change, producing content with that kind of impact really matters. But for Commercial Insight to have that kind of broad influence across the customer purchase, it must follow a precise set of design principles, for only a small fraction of the content most suppliers produced today is designed to drive that kind of behavior change. Chief among those designed principles is the idea that effective commercial insight isn't designed to teach so much as to unteach. Not teaching, but unteaching. Naturally, in order to capture customer attention, supplier content must have something valuable to say. But what exactly must it say in order to drive customer behavior change? What kind of content can do that? To figure that out, our team at CEB conducted a large scale survey of several 100 customer stakeholders all involved in A, B to B purchase across every major industry geography and go to market model. More precisely, we wanted to identify with data the kinds of content attributes that have a meaningful impact on customers current thinking. Whether that be the status quo or a particular course of action. In other words, the question we set out to answer was what kinds of supplier content can bend the path across the customer's ME to WE mountain? Now, to figure that out, one can't simply ask customers what will blow your mind. Because they likely won't know, and if they do, they probably wouldn't admit to it. So instead, we first asked customers to consider a recent purchase of a more complex solution, and then report the degree to which their direction across that purchase process changed on a scale from one to seven. Separately, we then asked respondents to score the value they place on various aspects of the content they typically consume as part of any purchase process. Anything from readability to relevance to data quality to credibility. When combined, those two sets of questions allowed us to statistically derive the potential impact of each of those inputs on actually changing customers purchase direction. And the result was fascinating. Before we turn to what does matter, it's instructive to look at what doesn't. Four. Of all the content attributes we tested, only two turned out to be statistically significant. Everything else had no statistically meaningful impact on changing our customer's purchase direction at all. So for example, the fact that content is easily accessible and quick to find has no bearing on customers likelihood to change their thinking. Nor does the degree to which content contains interesting facts or anecdotes, or whether it's easy to understand. Now, in many ways that makes a lot of sense. It seems unlikely that a customer would change course simply because a particular piece of content was easy to find and particularly well written. But one attribute that also doesn't matter was far more surprising. Among these statistically non significant drivers of changing customer buying direction was content representing a smart or expert perspective. For many suppliers, that finding is far more interesting, as that attribute reflects the stated strategy of most B to B marketers around the world. In a world awash in content of low quality and little relevance, many marketers would argue that the best way to stand out is through high quality content, representing a smart, distinctive perspective that clearly positions that supplier as a thought leader in their industry. The belief being that thought leadership is crucial to a supplier's ability to differentiate not only their content but also their capabilities. Surely, the thinking goes, a company that produces high quality thought leadership must also offer high quality solutions. It engenders trust. It conveys credibility. It tells customers we know things about the world and you should talk to us before you make a decision. In fact, across the last five years, bolstered by the rise of content marketing and new marketing automation technology, marketers have invested an enormous amount of time, money and resources into thought leadership for exactly these reasons. Indeed, many CMO's have told us it's their stated strategy for standing out in a crowded marketplace where they might otherwise become easily commoditized. But if that's the case, this data is rather troubling, as that strategy has no statistically measurable impact on changing actual customer buying behavior. Particularly in a world where suppliers compete with customer status quo as often as anything else, that's a worrying finding to say the least. So what does have a statistically significant impact on changing our customers purchase direction? In our analysis, we found only two drivers capable of reliably driving that kind of change. 1. Teaching the customers something new and compelling about their business and to providing customers with a compelling reason to take action. In other words, customers are most likely to rethink their current course or reset pre established buying criteria only when confronted with surprising information, not about the world in general, but about their own business. More specifically, information laying out not just the benefits of taking action. But the costs of inaction? It's this kind of content we've come to label insight. We'll get to the commercial part in just a bit. Regardless of whether it's delivered through a sales Rep conversation or some other content, Channel Insight is designed to demonstrate to customers that despite their own learning and their own expertise, they've missed something materially important to the performance of their business. A new way to make money, save money, mitigate risk, or penetrate new markets. All based on information that they themselves would not have discovered on their own. Insight, in other words, isn't designed just to teach customers something new that they've never thought before. But to unteach them something that they already have. Now we've been talking about Insight for a while now, as the concept has played a central role in our challenger work from the very beginning. While we've been careful to define the term as precisely as possible along the way, in working with companies all over the world, we've learned that as careful as we've been to define what insight is, we need to be equally careful to define what insight is not. Insight is not thought leadership. When it comes to insight, we find the term suffers from a strong false positive problem. As much of what passes under the name of Insight to Day falls into the much broader and arguably much less valuable category of thought leadership. So let's see if we can put some clear boundaries around what we mean by insight. If we think of all the different kinds of content a supplier might produce in the name of insight, we find there are a number of different layers to that content, each separated by a boundary delineating that layer from the next. Let's start with general information. General information is, well, just that information. That covers generally just about everything. It's that overwhelming flood of information out there that customers spend more time filtering out than taking in. So clearly the first hurdle suppliers need to overcome in building insight is to be heard in the first place to capture the customer's attention. So a supplier's first hurdle in content creation is ensuring that whatever they produce in the name of insight is credible and relevant. If customers don't believe what a supplier is saying, or don't believe it applies to them, that suppliers Insight isn't going to get a lot of attention. Of course, the bar for credibility may present a moving target in some cases, as what we call the burden of proof of a suppliers insight will largely determine how credible the information upon which that insight is based must be. The more counterintuitive or surprising the finding, the higher the burden of proof and therefore the more robust the evidence must be. But let's say the information a supplier publishes passes that first Test. It's both credible and relevant to the customer. That's fantastic. But it's still not insight. In fact, at this point, we've landed at only what we might call accepted information. What is that? Accepted information is credible, It's relevant, but frankly it's just not all that interesting. It sounds more or less like everyone elses information. Often taking the form of factoids or data points. There are a huge number of companies out there every day producing mountains of data, all in the name of insight that frankly represents nothing more than accepted information. Some examples. 90% of CIO's are concerned about what cloud computing means for their organization. 75% of CEO cite sustainability as a priority but admit they don't know how to achieve it. 80% of global workers report feeling disconnected from their work. These are all interesting, relevant, credible statistics. But still, they are statistics. They're not insight. Insight and data are not the same thing. More to the point, this data doesn't tell anyone anything new. Sure, we may not have known that it was 90% of CIO's who are worried about what cloud computing means for their organization, but we could have easily guessed it was a lot of them. That's the defining characteristic of accepted information. It doesn't tell someone something they didn't know. Rather, it largely confirms or validates something they already did. So customers won't necessarily ignore the information. They view it, read it, maybe download it, perhaps like it, and possibly even agree with it. But they probably won't do anything about it either. At least nothing they weren't going to do already. And yet, it's stunning the amount of content and collateral that's built on this type of information, all in the name of insight. So what's next? Let's move a step deeper across a boundary we'll call newsworthy. Clearly, if we want someone to act differently, we have to first get them to think differently. To do that, we're going to have to show them something truly newsworthy, and that brings us into the third layer of information. Thought leadership. Interestingly, above all other categories of content we've laid out so far, thought leadership is the one that can really get a supplier in trouble. Not only because this is the kind of content most suppliers are creating, but because it's the one most suppliers aspire to create. Virtually every marketer will tell you their company strives to be a thought leader in their industry. So what is thought leadership? It's interesting, newsworthy, incremental information that customers themselves likely could not have discovered on their own. So unlike accepted information, thought leadership is additive. It provides new perspectives or new data that teaches and doesn't just confirm. So to be fair, for the first time across our inventory of content, there really is some teaching happening at this third level. And that's great, for what it's worth. But the real limitation of traditional thought leadership is that it doesn't necessarily drive action. Readers learn, but they don't necessarily do. People may be liking or retweeting the content. But it isn't moving them to action. That's because most thought leadership is largely focused on presenting a new idea rather than undermining an existing one. So while thought leadership attracts a lot of attention, it typically has little lasting impact. We all think, wow, that's really interesting, and then we go back to whatever we were doing before. So it fails to have much commercial impact as it provides only a very weak means at best for driving customer behavior change. So what else is there? Well the next filter is be frame breaking. This is the final bar we need to clear for our content to truly be called Insight. But why that filter frame breaking? What we find is that insight is something else entirely. It's designed to upend the status quo. As such, insight isn't about one thing, It's about two things. It doesn't just convey an idea of what the customer could be doing, like thought leadership, but also conveys a story around what the customer is currently doing, explicitly laying out why that current behavior is costing the customer time. Or money in ways they never realized. That's the key. The contrast. It's the cost of current behavior juxtaposed to the potential of alternate action. Implicit in any good insight is the simple message, Hey, you're doing it wrong. And done well. It causes your customer to say I have to change what I'm doing. Thus the term frame breaking. That's a totally different outcome than one achieves from all of the traditional thought leadership that so many aspire to produce. Insight is a powerful tool to shape or reshape customer demand because it's designed to cause cognitive and emotional dissonance between current behavior and an alternate action. Customers reaction to well designed thought leadership is wow, they're smart. Customers reaction to well designed insight is. Wow, I'm wrong. Of course, as we've said all along the way, one delivers That message really matters. To be effective and not offensive, insight must be delivered professionally, diplomatically, empathetically and culturally correctly. It's about creating constructive tension, not just tension. Otherwise, it's not so much insight as just a plain insult. Still, when the CEB team is working with member companies on the insights they produce, the first thing we'll typically ask when a company shares an insight for feedback is. Show me the page, show me the data, point the bar graph the bullet point, the moment where you looked your customer in the eye, and tell them that they're wrong. If you can't find that moment in your content, no matter how diplomatically formulated, chances are pretty good you haven't created insight at all. As the commercial team at CDK Global, formerly ADP Dealer Services, likes to say. We have to teach our customers that the pain of saying is greater than the pain of change. Now, that said, we're still not done. We still have to ensure one gets paid for all of this work. So how does that work? Getting paid for insight. It's one thing to drive customers to do something different, but another thing entirely to ensure they do it with you. So imagine a scenario where a supplier teaches their customers something new. The customer then takes that insight, puts it out to bid and the suppliers direct competitor wins the business. That doesn't feel so good. And we'd agree. In fact, we call that free consulting. Few suppliers ever sustainably grew their business falling into that particular trap. So in order to ensure a supplier gets paid for all that insight, we still must pass through one last filter. That supplier must ensure that whatever they teach the customer about the customer's business actually leads back to some capability that that supplier is able to provide better than anyone else. Thus the term commercial insight or what we've called elsewhere, commercial teaching. It's insight that meets the frame breaking bar, but simultaneously leads the customer back to that particular supplier as the only one able to help them take action on that insight. So when the customer says wow, I gotta do something about this. Who can help me make this happen? That supplier must be able to legitimately look them in the eye and say let me show you how we are the only supplier who can help make that happen. Much of our work of late has been focused on helping members identify that set of unique benefits in their organization to serve as the foundation for this type of commercial insight. For, it turns out this is not an easy question to answer. In fact, it's not one question but three that a supplier must answer to do this well. The first is simply. One What are we good at? Hopefully that's a question the answer to which can fill a couple of pages as it refers not only to the features and benefits of the solutions of supplier cells, but to all the capabilities that surround that solution as well supply chain capabilities, financing opportunities, data-driven market perspectives. Whatever the case may be. Think broadly. The second question, however, is much harder. 2. What are we uniquely good At? This is where the pain kicks in, as most companies can successfully answer question one but struggle mightily with question 2. One head of sales at a food ingredients company once memorably asked us. In one part of our business, we sell salt. It's not fancy salt, it's not gourmet salt, it's not sea salt. It's just plain salt, Mountains of it. And our salt isn't any different from any one else's salt. What's the unique strength in that? Our answer was quite simple. We have no idea. Be that as it may, however, chances are pretty good that that supplier does indeed have some sort of unique strength somewhere in its salt business. But chances are equally good that that strength does not lie in the salt itself. In fact, that's almost definitionally the case. Instead, the unique strength of that business likely lies elsewhere in all the various capabilities that that company brings to bear to deliver that salt to market. Maybe it's something about where they mind the salt, creating shorter supply lines, thus enabling just in time delivery and reducing customers carrying costs. Perhaps it's their ability to mine salt around the world, allowing for an uninterrupted supply despite changing geopolitical and climatic conditions. Perhaps it's their uniquely strong financial arm which enables customers to buy certain financial instruments, allowing them to hedge against risk from fluctuating salt prices. Granted, these are all strengths we've made-up based on pure guesswork, but they're meant to be indicative of the wide net companies must cast when seeking to define their unique strengths. Should they focus too narrowly on their products and services alone, chances are pretty good they may overlook a number of potentially powerful differentiators. The third and final question. It's about time. 3. Which of our unique capabilities is sustainable? After all, an easily copied unique strength isn't much of A unique strength at all. So to sum it all up, what makes something a true differentiator? At its most basic level, a true differentiator is unique, valuable, defensible, and sustainable. It's a pretty straightforward list. But consider for a moment what that list rules out. Differentiators are not one features and benefits common in a suppliers market. Two outcomes the suppliers product generates or. 3. Vague descriptions or overused descriptions that include any of the following words. Innovative, green, user friendly, or solution. In many companies, we find that once one controls for those three things, there is virtually nothing left. In fact, in a recent CMO survey, we found only 1/5 of marketers could claim with confidence that their differentiator articulated a true difference in kind from the competition. IE we're different rather than a difference in degree. IE we're better. No, seriously, we're better. Not surprisingly then, only 13% felt they could pass what we consider to be the ultimate differentiator test. If we took all the names and logos off of your commercial content and gave it to a competitor to present to a customer, would that customer still necessarily have to buy from you? When you can say yes to that question, you've got something powerfully different to hang your commercial insight on. Winning as an organization, not as an individual. Notice how these aren't questions any commercial organization would want to leave up to their sales reps to figure out on their own. Indeed, we've watched a number of companies around the world do exactly that, often following the guidance of sales training vendors, leading almost inevitably to highly limited and potentially dangerous results. Simply putting sales reps through some kind of bootstrapped insight generation training with the assumption that building commercial insight is essentially a skill to be taught, similar to negotiation or presentation techniques, almost inescapably leads to weak insight. Building effective sustainable commercial insight requires a much broader organizational capability, if for no other reason than this stuff can be really hard. It takes multiple sources of information. It demands a deep understanding of a company's strategic direction. It requires access to customers well beyond just individual sales conversations. But most important, it requires broad, consistent application across a suppliers vast array of sales, service and marketing communications. All that is going to take time, patience, multiple iterations and consistent focused senior executive buy in to really work. What we're talking about here, in other words, is a fundamental review of how a company goes to market. While that question undoubtedly requires frontline input, it is nonetheless an inquiry best guided from the most senior ranks of an organization up to and including the CEO. Commercial insight isn't an individual sales technique nearly as much as organizational commercial strategy. The front end of that effort undoubtedly requires a very different way of thinking about customers. A very different kind of customer understanding. The last ten years have seen an explosion of interest in customer understanding, led in particular by marketing organizations seeking to ensure their company not only meets customer expectations, but exceeds them. Not surprisingly then, marketers have invested huge amounts of time, effort and money developing a wide-ranging toolbox to determine whether their organization is delivering a world class customer experience designed to offer memorable moments of delight across every possible customer touchpoint. While this work can span a wide range of activity, anything from interviews to focus groups to infield ethnographic research, much of it relies heavily on the most tried and true of marketing tools, the customer survey. Though, to be sure, those surveys have evolved significantly over time. From customer satisfaction to customer loyalty to voice of the customer to Net Promoter Score to customer experience. Indeed, commercial organizations around the world pour over the results of these surveys on a regular basis, often making large scale strategic decisions and allocating large amounts of company resources based solely on the information they contain. Yet as useful as those surveys are in retrospectively gauging company performance, it turns out they're virtually useless for proactively building world class commercial insight. Why? Because every one of those surveys is designed to test for the exact same thing. Customers perceptions of the supplier. Do you like us? Are you satisfied with us? Will you remain loyal to us? Are you willing to recommend us? Granted, those are all important things to know, but notice that they're all supplier focused. Each one provides an ever more accurate snapshot of how the customer views the supplier. But you'll remember, the key to commercial insight isn't a story about the supplier at all. It's a story about the customer and how they've missed something materially important to the performance of their business. As a result, in order to build world class commercial insight, suppliers don't necessarily need an ever more refined view of how customers perceive them. What they need is a significantly more refined view of how customers perceive themselves. Surprisingly, very little effort in the name of customer understanding today is designed to figure that out. In fact, a disturbingly large number of very senior marketers have told us they lack any real sense of how their customers view themselves. Some have even told us that they rarely, if ever, talk to their customers at all. But it turns out that kind of customer understanding is absolutely crucial for commercial insight to work. Because the only way to diplomatically tell a customer that they're wrong is to first understand what they believe in the first place. That set of beliefs is something we like to call a mental model. Building and breaking mental models. As we saw earlier, selling solutions is all about getting customers to change. Whether it's getting customers to move from buying nothing to buying something from buying from a competitor to buying from them, or from buying something from them to buying even more from them. Commercial teams primary mission is to move customers off of their current behavior and toward a new desired behavior. However, in a world where both individual customers, stakeholders, and entire customer organizations can learn on their own prior to ever engaging A supplier, the biggest challenge is getting customers to reconsider their current thinking in the first place, irrespective of whether that thinking entails criteria for a particular. Kind of purchase, or just as likely, a strong belief that the current status quo is already good enough. You'll remember this challenge presents at 2 levels or across two different movements. First we have to get a proto mobilizer to reconsider their individual thinking. Then we have to get the entire 5.4 to reconsider their collective thinking. But how do we do that? How do we get them to believe that change is not only possible but desirable? That undergoing the pain and disruption of shifting from their current behavior where they are now, to our desired behavior where they are more likely to purchase our solution is worth it in the first place. Well, the most common way is to paint the most attractive picture possible of how wonderful the world of the new behavior could be, if only the customer would just embrace it. So suppliers invest heavily in extolling the benefits of a world supported by their solution. They develop all sorts of data touting the benefits of the new behavior. They develop ROI calculators, showing customers how much money they can save by making the shift. They paint a broad, compelling picture of the unquestionable quality, cutting edge technology, proven reliability, and unlocked hidden value realized only by embracing that new direction. And they provide customer testimonials reflecting how wonderful life in that new world can be. And yet, suppliers are surprised and disappointed when, despite their best efforts, customers failed to respond favorably, ultimately choosing to remain steadfastly on course. Whatever they were doing already. They're left scratching their heads, wondering where did we go wrong? Do we need a different ROI calculator? Do we need better customer testimonials? Perhaps we should redesign our website. We need an urgency driver or what we really need is a sharper value proposition. The amount of soul searching, finger pointing, and second guessing that goes on at this point is enough to undermine even the very best of collaborative organizational cultures. But why is this such a struggle? Why is it so hard to redirect customer buying behavior? Well, what most suppliers fail to fully appreciate is that current behavior is significantly more entrenched than they might realize. Not simply because of some kind of broad organizational inertia or failure to appreciate the superiority of their solution. But rather due to an underlying set of beliefs and assumptions about how the world works. Psychologists call this a mental model. Our customers mental model dictates virtually everything that they do. That mental model doesn't just matter, it matters a lot. Because that's what's driving that customer's behavior in the first place. If you want to change behavior, you first have to change the mental model. It's the frame in the frame breaking we need to do to really call it insight. Put another way, the only way to change how a customer acts is to first change the way that that customer thinks. You'll remember from Chapter one the degree to which the mental models of each of the 5.4 are highly divergent. That it's not just one way of thinking we have to change, but potentially many more. Be that as it may, what we've consistently found in all of our research is that the best sales reps, challenger reps and the best companies, challenger organizations seek customers current mental models as the primary leverage point for driving customer behavior change. So rather than engaging customers in a debate on the merits of the suppliers proposed solution, the best suppliers engage their customers in a discussion of the customer's current beliefs. And in that discussion they diplomatically, empathetically, culturally, correctly, yet systematically break down their customers current mental model, show them how it's flawed or incomplete, and then articulate in very clear terms why a move the customer assumes would be too costly or too painful. Is actually less costly or painful than their current status quo. It's a careful, credible demonstration that the customer's current mental model is not only flawed, but costing them money or exposing them to risk in ways they never fully realized. That indeed, the pain of seeing is greater than the pain of change. This is the true power of commercial insight when it's done well. Not only does it paint a picture of how great life could be if they change, but far more important, it teaches customers that it's not nearly as good as they think it is, where they just stay the same. At the same time, this is what virtually every supplier is currently missing in their current content creation efforts. A disciplined, systematic approach to understanding and then replacing a customer's mental models. Bottom line, the only way to get customers to think differently about you is to first get them to think differently about themselves. This is why efforts to understand how customers perceive themselves in the first place are so important. Without that very different kind of customer understanding, a supplier can't build the mental model in the first place. And without that mental model, a supplier can't effectively overturn a customer's current thinking. One can't change the way a customer thinks of themselves if they don't even know how that customer thinks of themselves in the first place. So what exactly is a mental model and how would one build 1? We'll cover that with some very concrete practical examples in Chapter 5. But for now, let's sum up everything we've learned about commercial insight in a single, simple but powerful explanation. Breakdown the A, then build up the B. To simplify what admittedly at first glance must feel like a relatively complex idea, let's boil this down to two simple things. The customer is current beliefs and behavior on the one hand, and their desired beliefs and behaviors on the other. Here desired refers to what a supplier essentially hopes a customer will believe and do, as that behavior will most likely lead directly to the adoption of that suppliers solution. Imagine a diagram with a large A on the left connected by an arrow to a large B on the right. We like this model because it allows us to ask a very simple but rather telling question. If you were to consider all of the collateral, all of the pitch decks, all of the content your organization currently creates in an attempt to get customers to buy your solution, what's it mostly about? Is it primarily about the a current beliefs slash behavior or is it largely about the be desired beliefs slash behavior? For most organizations, the predominant answer is by far the bee. For reasons we just discussed, suppliers bend over backward extolling the virtues of the bee. Painting as attractive a picture as possible of life over there on the right, in a world supported by their solution. So they walk through its utility, calculate its return, demonstrate its value, and enumerate its benefits. All in an attempt to convince customers, through sheer force of persuasion that whatever they're doing over on the left couldn't possibly be as good as what the suppliers suggest they could be doing over on the right. By and large, it is a battle for the bee. But the strange thing is, more often than not, suppliers will win that battle but still lose the war. Customers will look them in the eye, emphatically agree that B is indeed better, but still not budge off their current behavior. When that happens, suppliers natural inclination is to conclude that their articulation of the bee must need further refinement. For clearly if it were more compelling than that customer would make that move. But all that added effort rarely returns additional benefit. As one senior leader memorably told us, if our value proposition got any crisper, we'd have to write it on a cracker. But it's still not enough. After studying this problem for the better part of five years, we've come to conclude the real challenge in changing customer buying behavior isn't a better articulation of the benefits of B. It's a better articulation of the pain of a. Without that, the bee may seem great, but the A still remains good enough. Winning a solution sale, in other words, isn't so much a battle for the B nearly so much as a battle for the A. Or, as we like to say, you have to break down the A before you build up the B. Again, that's the moment where you must tell the customer, diplomatically, empathetically and culturally correctly, that they're wrong. Notice how different this kind of message really is. Once CMO examined this diagram and said there's nothing new here, this is just marketing 101. It's a basic value proposition. But that's not the case at all. In fact, for many sales and marketing professionals, the ABC statement is completely counterintuitive relative to everything they've been trained to do in the past. How exactly? Consider this, when done well, who is the A about? It's about the customer. But then who is the be about? It's also about the customer. But if that's the case, then where in the world is the supplier in all of this? Now some like to say the supplier is in the arrow. But that's not really correct either. For what that arrow really represents is the behavior change the customer would have to undergo to get from A to B. So where is the supplier in the A to B statement? The answer is they aren't there at all. The AW statement isn't a story about the supplier. It's a story about the customer. Done properly, its supplier agnostic. That's pretty counterintuitive. Who ever heard of a supplier value proposition that doesn't include the actual supplier? But that's not really what the A to B represents. It's not so much a value proposition designed to articulate a suppliers capabilities as it is a value proposition designed to articulate the return from customer behavior change. That makes a lot of sense, since at the end of the day, that's exactly what a supplier is selling anyway. So if you wanted to assign a letter to the supplier, then arguably they would be the C. They're the natural end point of the AB story. For if a supplier effectively breaks down the A and then successfully builds up the B. That customer is going to look at that supplier and say I've got to change, but who can help me with this? That supplier must be able to say. Let me show you how. We are the only supplier that can help you with this. That's the power of commercial insight. So how does a commercial organization build something like that? We'll look at some very concrete examples in chapter 5, but here's a simple four question exercise to get you started. Four questions to build commercial insight. Admittedly, building commercial insight is not easy. It takes broad based commitment and collaboration across the entire commercial organization. Everyone from marketers to product managers to sales managers to sales reps to senior leaders, and arguably more. In fact, based on a widespread demand, CEB has been running a series of sold out workshops around the world for our members designed to help companies think through a step by step framework for building commercial insight. Our consulting arm has worked hand in hand with countless organizations to build not only commercial insights, but more sustainable commercial insight capabilities across those organizations. All of the work can be boiled down to four questions that can kickstart any companies commercial insight design efforts. Each question is designed to pick up a part of the story. We think you'll find these questions to be especially helpful as you start your own journey toward building commercial insight. Question #1. What are our sustainable, unique strengths? Remember, think broadly. Question #2. Of those unique strengths, which ones are currently under appreciated by our customers? This one is especially counterintuitive, as it forces you to think in the exact opposite direction of where you might naturally go on your own. After all, once you identify your unique, sustainable strengths, it seems like you'd be done. Put that in the value proposition and away you go. But remember, we just saw how that plays out. That's a story of the bee. What we're looking for is a story of the A. Question #3. What is it that the customer fails to fully understand about their business that leads them to underappreciate our unique sustainable capability now? Note the emphasis. This isn't a question of what the customer fails to understand about the suppliers business, it's a question of what the customer fails to understand about their own business. This is where a very different kind of customer understanding is absolutely crucial. This is the a with a view toward what the customer is missing. A different way to ask the same question might be what is there A and how is it broken? A clear understanding of the customer's current mental model allows us to then ask. Question #4. What would we have to teach that customer about their business that would lead them to value that capability more than they do now? Or put another way, how can we credibly break down their A and build up their B? We've run those four questions in workshop format with sales and marketing teams around the world, and the results are always fascinating. As a result of the exercise, commercial leaders are almost always surprised by both what they already know, if they just think about things a little bit differently, and what they don't really know because they never thought to ask. It's an exciting yet simultaneously humbling exercise, but it's virtually always a productive 1. For if nothing else, it leads to a series of natural follow on questions that can provide productive work streams for members of the commercial team. Things like. What kind of evidence would we need to credibly convince customers of what we're saying? How high is the burden of proof of our argument? How much of that evidence do we have now? How slash where could we build or buy the evidence that we're missing? For if we bring things full circle, remember that this is a story of activating mobilizers, engaging them in a conversation that they'll find compelling enough to want to act on, and then equipping them with the evidence they'll need to win over the other 4.4 despite potentially high levels of internal dysfunction. That is why commercial insight matters so much. It's less a solution for how suppliers struggle to sell and far more a solution for why customers struggle to buy. Or, more accurately, why they struggle so mightily to change. So let's move on to chapter four and breakdown the process of commercial insight creation in more detail with some concrete examples.\n"

      "Content: Chapter 10. Shifting to a Challenger commercial model - implications and implementation lessons.  To win today, you need a challenger inside the customer organization. That is the central premise of this entire book. It turns out the far bigger story isn't about suppliers struggle to sell solutions, It's the customers struggle to buy them. Arming mobilizers with world class commercial insights and supporting their efforts to rally consensus for that insight and inherently then for your solution, requires a new go to market strategy. The implications of such a significant shift in commercial strategy are numerous. Sales and marketing must work together, bound by a new common language of disruption. Seller skills, something we covered in depth in the Challenger sale, must be reconsidered. Marketing content must be atomized and lead customers to a clear narrative that discloses what they've gotten wrong. There are likely sales coverage and territory implications for many organizations as more capable sales talent is aligned to prime growth markets. To say this shift happens overnight or even within a single year is not realistic. This shift takes time. It takes coordination among sales, marketing, and product teams. And above all else, it requires strong and continuous senior leadership support. That being said, there are a handful of implications that our research has highlighted as particularly tricky to navigate. What follows is by no means an exhaustive summary of change management paces. Instead, these are a series of implications that many organizations get wrong from the outset. Left untreated, these implications can undermine your organization's efforts to make this shift entirely. We'd even argue that attempting to make this shift without properly accounting for these implications is downright dangerous. So what are these implications? Implication #1 Demand generation. Most marketing teams aim their demand generation efforts at developing leads that are ready to buy. Traditional criteria of balance budget authority, need and timing dominate demand generation efforts. True, while this approach delivers a ready made customer to the sales team, it fails to do so on your terms. This approach does nothing to shape demand and create high quality leads. We call that mobilizing demand and we'll explore it here. Implication #2. Marketing talent. Most marketing teams are disproportionately focusing their skill building in the digital space. While we agree that's necessary to a degree, there are a set of skills related to the consensus purchase that are being overlooked. These skills are the ones that drive a marketer's ability to create and deploy commercial insight. These skills are more important than digital skills because go to market strategy rests upon them. Implication #3. Social selling. While it's clear that sales reps ought to be using social media tools to engage customers, we observe many social selling efforts that amount to little more than broadcasting, or perhaps more accurately, noise. Yet there's a powerful role for social media in the Mobilizer purchase. It centers on challenging mobilizer mental models in social media, where mobilizers increasingly go to learn. We'll explore how marketing and sales need to collaborate to deliver social teaching, not social selling. Implication #4 Managing blockers. Blockers can quickly demoralize your sales teams as they engage in consensus building efforts. Sellers must confidently address blockers and neutralize their influence for high quality consensus to be forged. Far and away the prevailing thought for managing blockers, however, is to ignore them. Rarely do sales methods teach approaches for blocker management. Even rarer are instances where sales managers ask who the blocker for a deal might be and what should be done to minimize their influence. So it should come as no surprise that sellers do the same, hoping the blocker goes away or relinquishes their objections. We'll explore several methods for actively managing blockers in this section. Implication #5. Sales Process and Opportunity Planning. The sales process has long centered on providing a clear frame of reference for seller actions, sequenced in order to maximize sales velocity, create a series of stages that dictate sales progress as well as govern next steps with customers. Remember, much of the commoditization pressure suppliers face today isn't the result of customers willingness to settle for good enough. It's their failure to agree on anything more. Today's sales process must better reflect how sellers can enable the right customer purchase behaviors rather than March a deal forward through the suppliers sales stages. Similarly, opportunity planning follows the same logic. Let's dive into these implications. Implication #1 Demand generation. In this section, we'll take a look at how marketing needs to rethink its demand generation system as a result of the insights CEB research has uncovered about the consensus purchase and the role of mobilizers. By demand generation system, we mean the people, process, technology and data that go into lead generation, lead scoring and lead nurturing. Clearly, this is a large and growing area of investment for marketing organizations, and it's a key piece of achieving greater marketing accountability. The stakes for getting this right couldn't be higher. Here's the risk boiled down to its simplest. If marketers rely on a bad go to market strategy to drive what they put into their demand Gen. systems and how they tune those systems out of the other side, they're going to get bad demand demand that leads to low quality commoditized deals as described in chapter one. Unfortunately, as we've researched all that's been written about demand generation in the blogosphere, we believe much of the conventional wisdom is based on an outdated conception of B to be purchasing. Based on the consensus and mobilizer dynamics uncovered by CEB Research, we believe the conventional wisdom is taking marketers in the wrong direction. If you pick up a white paper from most any marketing automation supplier or read A blog post from a content marketing guru, the conventional wisdom goes something like this. It's an increasingly noisy world, so breaking through to B to B buyers is tough. To breakthrough, you need great content. Great content isn't about you, it's about the customer. In fact, it's not about the demo from a graphic customer. For example, CIO's at companies larger than $100 million in revenue. It's about buyer archetypes or personas and their pain points and objectives. Businesses don't make purchase decisions. After all, People do. Personalize your content to these personas. Be present with your content in the spots they frequent. Say smart things so they think of you first when they're ready to evaluate suppliers. Set up your marketing automation to drive engagement with these personas to nurture them. Feed them content that further speaks to those persona pain points and objectives and whatever they need at that stage of the purchased journey. Measure purchase readiness by level of engagement and signals of bands budget authority. Need timing. Pass those nurtured leads to sales foreclosure. High fives all around. Open champagne to celebrate. Sounds great, doesn't it? Much of this wisdom feels so right. How could this possibly be so wrong? By now, having read the preceding chapters, chances are you can point to a few spots where this conventional wisdom might lead marketers astray. There are three main failure points. One conventional wisdom leads us down a path of creating ever more content, and content quantity quickly Trump's content quality. Coupled with the drive to generate leads and outbound marketing efforts, marketers risk turning off customers who are already bombarded with supplier messages. Two, conventional wisdom is mum on the absolute criticality of upending how customers think of their own business, thereby changing the customers direction when they are learning on their own. That means marketers will generate demand that commoditize their own solution. 3. Conventional wisdom is about better connecting individuals in a buying group to you as a supplier, not about connecting them to each other. So marketers will fail to lay the groundwork for the early consensus that needs to happen about the problem and the solution. Forget about the supplier. Let's unpack those in turn. The failures of demand generation. The first failure point is very straightforward. Marketing creates all of that content in its drive to engage, engage and engage. The thinking goes something like. Be present on a regular basis for each of my major personas in all the places they go for information. Since I've got all that content, go ahead and blast it out through e-mail campaigns and other outbound communications. Deep down, marketers know what happens here, right? Customers get turned off as the quality of content inexorably slips when marketing teams face the pressure of creating the quantity of content that conventional wisdom encourages. Customers inherently tune out suppliers, or even worse, they badmouth suppliers in social forums or refused to take visits from suppliers sales reps. We heard the following spooky anecdote from one prominent demand generation leader who heads up regional marketing for a Fortune 100 tech provider. Over an 18 month period, fully 60% of this suppliers opt in. Customer database has opted out. This supplier was no demand Gen. slouch either. They have been a pioneer in demand, Jen. In a crazy, noisy world, something starts to give if we continue to operate by an outbound engagement obsessed demand Gen. model. On the second failure path, the conventional wisdom. Approach will lead to smaller deals at lower margins by delivering what we call established demand. Established demand is the exact opposite of high quality deals that we discussed in Chapter one. Established demand comes from customers who learn on their own norm around minimum thresholds and then invite a supplier in to compete with two other suppliers in the Price based Bake Off. It's the one of three commoditization problem in spades. These are customers who might have read some of your thought leadership as they went about the research process. But they never had their perspective changed about the way their business currently works. So their view of what they need to purchase is established by the time you engage this customer. If you revisit the conventional wisdom, nowhere are we explicitly confronting customer mental models. However, that's what suppliers need to do to knock the commoditization freight train off its tracks. That's the way to change the customer's direction when they wait until they are 57% of the way through their purchase experience before reaching out to a supplier. In the conventional wisdom all marketers are called on to do is create content that speaks to customers known pain points or that demonstrates how smart they are as a supplier. Recall from chapter three, such approaches do not work because they don't change the customers direction. The conventional wisdom encourages that freight train. Vance based lead scoring criteria detect customers who have budget, a clear need and a set timeline for purchase. Leads that show all of these qualities garner more points in marketers, lead scoring systems and get passed to sales. Two main competitors to extract the best price. What sales Rep wants to waste time chasing that opportunity? This is one of the primary reasons our research shows that the highest performing sellers deprioritize marketing qualified leads. Let's touch on the third failure path, which has to do with consensus. The conventional wisdom would have marketers build stronger connections between their companies as suppliers and people in the customer organization. Marketing creates content that is tailored to personas, on the theory that if suppliers can engage those personas more deeply, they can boost customer willingness to buy from them and that will translate into more deals. But by now we know that individual willingness to buy in a consensus purchase means very little. The conventional wisdom largely misses this consensus dynamic. Personalizing messaging and content to such an extreme leads to driving diverse buying group stakeholders further apart. Even in the best case, this approach will lead suppliers to get a collection of individual yeses, but we know that's insufficient too. It's no wonder that based on CEB demand Gen. benchmarking research, only 3% of marketing qualified leads ever convert into deals. And that's on a good day. How many leads never have a chance to progress further because that stakeholder doesn't feel equipped to help Dr. consensus in her organization around the problem or solution, much less the supplier? Based on CEB research, that's likely happening to a large chunk of the 97% of marketing qualified leads that don't ever progress. Many of those prospect nibbles you get on your white papers, webinars, infographics and demand Gen. emails. Those are nibbles from solitary stakeholders making their daily rounds of industry news sites or LinkedIn groups. They engage because you spoke to their pain points, but they don't come away feeling there's any chance to overcome inertia and create consensus in their large organizations. And that's where the lead dies. Don't generate demand. Mobilize demand. To fix these failure points, suppliers need a demand generation system that accounts for the critical role of mobilizers in overcoming group dysfunction and stitching together consensus. It has to be one that accounts for the peak dysfunction of consensus happening 37% of the way through the purchase, long before sales reps meaningfully get involved. Here's what that looks like at a high level. We'll come back to unpack each one of these in more detail, but the themes will be familiar from what you've heard so far. One, create content paths that confront and connect. Recall from earlier chapters, we need Spark, Introduce, Confront Content for several reasons. It attracts the mobilizers we need. It forms the basis for collective learning at its most powerful, and thereby helps Dr. Consensus. The only way to change the customers direction is by changing their mental models, not through thought leadership or content that is useful to target personas. Moreover, if marketing has created those Spark introduced Confront Content paths for mobilizers to encounter and get pulled into, they are mobilizing high quality deals. Marketing is intercepting and changing the direction of mobilizers before any kind of consensus on the nature of the problem or solution is starting to gel in the customer organization. Through Spark, Introduce, Confront content marketing has greatly improved the chances of shaping that early demand to favor the suppliers unique strengths. Two are just lead scoring criteria to reflect confrontation and connection. Marketing should score leads in a way that gauges how much those leads have been disrupted by content and how well these suppliers content has connected buying group stakeholders within the same account to one another. To do that, marketing will need to tag content according to whether it 1 sparks, two introduces or three confronts. See Chapter 6 for more detail. That's well within the capabilities of content management and marketing automation technology today. Marketing will also want to assign more points for engaging multiple customer stakeholders on the same idea. So as marketing automation systems detect individual stakeholders engaging with content that is more disruptive, either introducing or personalizing disruptive ideas, marketing should also program those systems to detect when that stakeholder has shared that content or when peers stakeholders. In the same customer organization, have engaged with the same kinds of disruptive content. That kind of activity will indicate that groundwork is being laid for consensus in the customer organization. Marketing should assign more points to those leads. Clever design of content with sharing and targeted gating built in as in these skill soft mobilizer toolkit enables marketing to do this kind of lead scoring. Think about how powerful it is to know if you've got a prospective customer who is engaging with content that reflects your commercial insight and who is sharing that with other stakeholders. That's the kind of demand our systems should prioritize. See how different that is from typical bat based and engagement based scoring criteria. Instead of assigning points for purchase readiness bands, which tells you how close you are to capturing established demand that leads to commoditization. You are now gauging how disrupted the prospect is. As well, instead of scoring leads on individual engagement, where you assign progressively more points to content that requires more and more time from prospects, you are giving points for multi stakeholder consumption of counterintuitive content no matter what form it takes. Engagement for engagement sake is meaningless. Marketers should focus on spark, introduce, confront engagement that begins to rally the broader set of buying group stakeholders. Modest points for Spark Content, more points for Introduce Content and lots of points for Confront Content. Bonus points when any of this content is shared with or consumed by fellow account level stakeholders. 3 Nurture leads explicitly for commercial insight and collective learning. Now, when you have leads that aren't yet qualified to be passed to sales for closing, you'll know more precisely what to engage them with next. It will be driven by the likely state of mental disruption and stakeholder connectedness at a prospective account. For example, if you've generated a lead in which one stakeholder who has consumed spark and introduced content, and another lead from a stakeholder at the same account who has consumed only spark content, you might want to put confront Content in front of the first stakeholder and invite her to bring in the other stakeholder. Maybe that's a pain calculator or a diagnostic that the stakeholders work on together so they can learn around a common rallying point. Or perhaps this is where you'd suggest a collective learning workshop, bringing in the sales Rep to help execute. This is a very different approach to nurturing. The typical approach is oriented to feeding stakeholders with a predefined string of progressively more engaging content. Too often, engaging here means content that provides more detail and therefore takes more time to consume. They engaged with our infographic. Let's send them a white paper. Or they saw our white paper. Let's invite them to a webinar. Just because a piece of content provides more detail doesn't mean it's done anything at all to further overcome the customer's mental model or lay the groundwork for consensus. Because nurturing paths are built on customers, most common purchase path, one where they learn on their own and commoditize suppliers, marketers may be unwittingly feeding them content that greases the tracks for the commoditization freight train. How to Know if You're Mobilizing Demand? If you've taken these three steps to reorient your demand systems so that it mobilizes demand, what should you expect? How will common demand metrics move? In the following we layout the common demand indicators and how those are likely to change. This is important to understand because you're going to want to set expectations in the broader commercial organization and even the C-Suite on what will happen to demand as you reorient from generation to mobilization. If you're doing this well, overall lead volume may initially dip because you should be producing less content than you're putting into the marketplace. However, that new content will begin to take on a life of its own as it is more likely to get shared and picked up in earned media. Based on our experience working with commercial teams here, this can take upwards of 12 to 18 months, but you'll see lead volume increase. More important, lead quality will improve provided you've redefined lead quality to reflect emerging demand and not establish demand. That's because you've engineered content to attract mobilizers early on, when suppliers still have a chance to shape how the customer defines the problem and nature of the solution. Now, over time, as your improved content finds its way through earned and shared channels into a broader part of the marketplace, you may find that you get inbound inquiries that don't qualify as leads. You can catch the attention of a variety of marketplace actors and industry players, from industry associations to sole proprietors of small businesses to academics. Inquiries will increase because these players want to learn more about what was under that surprising content. But those should not be interpreted as poor leads or included in any kind of lead dashboard. The key metric to pay attention to here is therefore absolute volume of quality leads. Shifting from a generating demand to a mobilizing demand approach should also increase sales generated leads. Marketing should be equipping sales with counterintuitive social sound bites to help reps engage customers early in their passive learning process on LinkedIn and other social communities. See the implication on social selling later in this chapter. Because Spark introduced Confront Content is more likely to catch attention and get shared, it should boost sales reps ability to source leads through their own social networks. Win rates and deal profitability should also increase. You should be able to get ahead of the RFP and influence not just buying criteria, but the minimum thresholds of performance for those criteria. That translates to higher win rate, larger deal size and or larger margins. Based on CEB research and our members experiences, 15 to 20% price premiums are not unusual for demand that is mobilized and carried through to the sales interaction. It's the same effect that John Goetz, the Xerox account executive, described back in Chapter 5 in Using the Color Drive Student Performance Insight. It's as if the door closes, I'm on the inside and everyone else is on the outside. So far so good. Higher volume of quality leads after an initial downtick. Larger deals, better margins, higher close rates. But what about sales cycle time? There are multiple forces driving cycle times in different directions here. It's very likely that prospective customers will encounter that Spark introduced Confront Content earlier in their purchase journey. They may encounter content in a passive learning stage, perhaps in earned media, before they even begin the journey. That can, in a way, start the purchase clock early if you measure cycle time from the first moment that you have a lead through to deal clothes. All else equal, that might extend sales cycle time. On the flip side, there are also forces shortening sales cycle time. By engaging mobilizers early and equipping them with content and tools that they use to drive consensus in the buying group and surface stakeholder objections early, you canmore effectively build Deal momentum, much like Alpha Company accomplished in its Collective Learning workshops from Chapter 9. That will enable those buying groups to agree on more larger problems and more valuable solutions, and more quickly than if you aren't connecting them early to overcome group dysfunction. Soft indicators of success. If you step back to look at the big picture on KPIs, you'll see that motivating this shift in content and demand generation strategy takes some courage. You're likely to face short term pressure on lead, quality and cycle time as you give the marketplace a chance to digest content. It has to work its way through sharing channels. It has to get noticed and picked up in earned media and by influencers. Mobilizers have to encounter that content, share it with fellow stakeholders and rally around it. As we've talked to CEB members who have been on this demand mobilization journey, they shared with us the confidence giving softer indicators that let you know you're on the right track, especially in the face of some dashboard KPI's that may move temporarily in the wrong direction. You can visualize in a demand funnel. In the pre funnel stage, you'll know you're on the right track if you experience these kinds of things. Proprietary term adoption. You'll begin to see terms that you've coined get used in social media or maybe even adopted by the broader marketplace. See the Cisco example from Chapter 9. Third party references earned media outlets, notable bloggers, and other influencers will start to reference your commercial insight. They love surprising or counterintuitive information, after all. Invitations to present your insights. Rather than having to pay for event sponsorships, you'll start to get invited to present on your commercial insight. That's because your content is less likely to be about you as a supplier and more about these surprising things going on in your customers businesses. If you experience any of these kinds of events, you'll know you're on the right track. Likewise, you should start to see the following kinds of soft indicators in the demand funnel itself. Early engagement with new key decision makers. Your content is winning early Salesforce engagement with decision makers, ones that you hadn't engaged before. Recall from chapters 5 and six how Xerox was able to engage with a new set of more senior decision makers outside of IT. Positive sales force sentiment on lead quality. You'll hear instances of very positive feedback from the sales force on the different in kind discussions that they are able to have with marketing sourced leads who are primed by your content to learn more about your commercial insight and how it applies to their business. Instances of getting ahead of the RFP slash. No bid contracts. You'll hear examples from your sales force of content helping to get ahead of the RFP or spark no bid contract situations. Recall from Chapter 9 how Skill Sauce Mobilizer Toolkit is enabling this. When you experience these kinds of events, celebrate them. Share credit liberally with your team and your sales colleagues. If you've done this right, they were your copilots all along in designing a demand mobilization system. Above all, take courage to fight through the tough parts of the journey. Companies who have moved in this direction, like Xerox, Smart Skill Soft and others tell us the prize is worth the fight. Implication #2. Marketing talent. The chief talent question marketing leaders should be interested in is have I got the right marketer talent to thrive in the world of the consensus purchase? CEB has studied this question quantitatively with special focus on marketers abilities to generate and deploy commercial insight. After all, commercial insight is the key to engaging mobilizers early. If you can get that right, you'll have set your commercial organization up for success against the consensus dynamic. Here's the key take away. Commercial insight, skills and knowledge are in short supply. Moreover, it takes a special blend of those skills and knowledge put into the right operating environment to successfully build and deploy commercial insight. In other words, this can't be left to chance or to heroism on the marketing team. Marketing leaders need to step in to engineer the right kinds of working teams and create a particular kind of environment that nurtures commercial insight creation. Now here are the details. To study this, we conducted survey based quantitative research. We surveyed over 580 marketers in different roles and at different levels from 29 different B to B suppliers around the world. In these surveys, we had marketers self assess their performance across a wide range of attributes, skills, attitudes, knowledge, experience and their work environment. We then had the heads of marketing from each of those companies assess each of their survey participants on their ability across four skills we consider crucial to commercial insight creation. Finally, we then use statistical analysis to determine of all the things you could do well as a marketer, what matters most in building and deploying commercial insight. Here's what we found. First, let's look at the four skills we used as a proxy for commercial insight ability. These are the four skills that heads of marketing scored each of their people on. We looked at marketers ability to one generate insight that reshapes how customers think about their business. To understand and articulate their companies differentiated capabilities and benefits. Three, connect those insights about customers back to the suppliers 's unique capabilities. Four, package all of that in compelling messages across a variety of content types, including sales collateral and other sales support. These are the commercial insight indicators or outcomes we studied. In a moment, we'll take a look at the drivers of these indicators. But let's pause on these indicators for a moment. The first observation is on a scale of 1 to 5, marketers are pretty average at these commercial insight indicators as judged by their marketing leaders. Not great, not horrible, just sort of neutral. There is clearly room to run on improving marketers performance on the skills that matter most for commercial insight. One thing worth noting, when we conducted the survey, we specifically asked participating heads of marketing to select only those members of their team who play a role in the creation of content and messaging. So this is an X-ray of the messaging and content engine itself. When you look at the distribution of marketer performance, you'll find that only one out of four marketers averages above a four. Major deals arise from understanding the customers business better than they understand it themselves, At least where your capabilities intersect the customer business. This is a high bar we're talking about here. When we think about the level of skill we need, it's troubling to see how few marketers excel at the skills required to counter customers thinking. It raises an interesting challenge for marketing leaders. How do I get more of my team above that threshold? Can I shift them there, or will I need to hire new people altogether? To answer that question, we need to better understand the drivers of our four commercial insight indicators. We included a wide variety of potential drivers in our survey. What you see are the factors that mattered most in driving marketers commercial insight indicators. They bundle into five statistically significant drivers. Think of these as categories of attributes that naturally move together and drive those four commercial insight indicators. In case you're wondering about the scores, the number represents the increase in score on a 5 point scale that we'd expect to see if we improve performance from below average to above average. So for example Customer native measures 0.21. That means improving from bottom quartile to top quartile performance on customer native attributes would increase a marketers commercial insight performance on a 5 point scale by 0.21 points. Now you're probably wondering, is 0.21 points a lot? Seems kind of small. But when you Add all these scores together, which represents improvement on all these skills, you see a very dramatic impact on overall Commercial Insight performance. If you were to realize the full benefit of each of these scores combined, that would mean moving a marketer from average level of Commercial insight performance to the top 15%. That's a big deal because it means moving into the zone of creating and deploying commercial insight that can lead to a quantum jump in commercial results. Let's unpack what's in each of these scores. To understand what's underneath these findings, we have to transport ourselves into the actual meetings where these teams are trying to generate commercial insight in the first place. They're looking for potential hidden connections in the customers business that customers themselves fail to appreciate. They're hunting for clues to find these connections. They're mapping customer mental models depicting how that customer's business works and how they make money. They're looking for a place in that model where they can tell customers they're wrong. Then they're finding creative ways to spark, introduce and confront customers with those messages at arms length. That's not easy. So what does it take? Well, First things first, let's unpack the first driver, customer native. What this driver captures is a world class marketers ability to truly understand the customer, their motivations, their decisions, how they speak, what they're thinking. For example, within this driver you'll find activities like hypothesized needs. The best commercial insight marketers can anticipate customer needs before the customers themselves. This goes way beyond asking customers what they need or staring at backward looking data about what customers have ordered. This demands a knowledge of customers that lets you hypothesize what they don't yet even realize they need. That's the key to teaching. It's all about finding unrecognized customer needs. That second biggest driver is labeled investigative. This is more about the posture and traits of the folks you want on the Commercial Insight team. Think of this as a detective type of posture. Always asking why? Sorting through mountains of ambiguous information. Testing assumptions. These marketers are looking for clues in their customers business environment, in their own data about customers, in current market trends and especially in unusual customer stories that might normally be dismissed. All with the aim of connecting information in new ways to show customers how their mental models are off base. Also note the not overly confident sub driver under the investigative heading. There's a type of marketer out there who runs against this investigative posture that you definitely do not want on your commercial insight team. That's the overconfident marketer who assumes he already knows what the customer needs and rationalizes away any evidence to the contrary. The third biggest driver is labeled business savvy. This one is really interesting not just for what it is, but also for what it's not. It turns out marketers with a consulting or strategic planning background perform well on our four commercial insight indicators, and people with a deep background in data, slash analytics or creative design don't. Why? Well, the business savvy brings two things to the table. First, these folks are already good at building and tearing down mental models. That's essentially what consulting or strategic planning has trained them to do. Work through complex and ambiguous problems. They live for that. Second, they bring with them an extensive mental library of business and economic frameworks, how money is made and how business models work in a whole range of industries and situations. That's a critical ingredient for landing on commercial insight, finding the hidden connections that aren't just hidden but economically meaningful. Think about dense ply and the modeling of absenteeism cost on the profitability of the dentist practice. Those are the first three sets of drivers. They all fit under a people heading because they're more about the attributes of the individual people who are building and deploying commercial insight. It's a special blend of skills, background and knowledge. The data tells us it's quite likely that you wouldn't find this blend in any single person. That's borne out in our experience working with organizations on commercial insight, too. Building and deploying commercial insight is more of a team sport. Commercial leaders will probably have to look beyond marketing to product strategy, sales insights, maybe even R&D to find the right people mix here. The crucial implication is staffing for commercial insight can't be left to chance. It's not to be taken on by a casual mix of frontline marketers or volunteers. Commercial leaders need to deliberately engineer the right blend of people. Now commercial leaders also need to set the right operating conditions for these people to work in. That's what the last two drivers speak to and why we put them under an environment heading. The first one of these two drivers is Co creative teams. Coming up with commercial insight is an organic, interactive, synthetic exercise. As a result, commercial leaders have to foster an environment where sharing and building on one another's ideas is not just encouraged. But expected. Remember, commercial insight, by definition is disruptive. Some of the best ideas are going to seem pretty far fetched at first glance. They'll run counter. To how customers currently view their world. Under this driver, we observe that the best performing teams have marketing and sales working together on this, collaborating to build on each other 's experience and synthesize different ideas, and willing to accept when their ideas may not win out. Also under this Co creative teams driver, we observed an interesting dynamic about the high performing teams not feeling like it was necessary to take turns to talk. We think this one showed up because commercial organizations often bring together teams that are too large to generate commercial insight. Four to five people is the ideal size. If you've got 7-8 or more, chances are pretty good you've already made some sacrifices on the people's skills and traits we've discussed. Then, whenever you get groups that large, the team feels compelled to include everyone's thinking, and that dilutes your keen insights. It's the one pizza rule. If you have to order two pizzas to feed the team for late night work sessions, the team is too big. The second of the environment drivers is encourage risks. By now, this one should come as no surprise. Generating commercial insight is fundamentally a creative task, and if you don't encourage risk taking, you're not going to get the lateral thinking and outlier ideas that end up being the richest kernels of commercial insight. If you are to get breakthrough commercial insight, this is the kind of people mix and environment you need to engineer as marketing leaders. This responsibility extends to sales and product leaders as well, given the mix of talent that is required to generate commercial insight. Implication #3 Social selling. In chapter five, we focused on using content to challenge mobilizers mental models early. It's absolutely critical for marketing to do this, but that doesn't mean commercial organization should give up on getting sales reps to engage with mobilizers to begin breaking down the A as early as possible. The rise of social media gives occasion for marketing and sales to work together to create these early teaching opportunities. It looks very different from the typical broadcast approach we see commercial organizations taking to do social selling. One of the key questions that our research highlighting that customers are 57% of the way through a purchase surface is if customers are delaying contact with supplier sales reps, how is it that some sales reps are still managing to get in early? What are they doing differently? So we studied sales Rep behavior to find out. That question led us to study sales Rep behavior on engaging customers early, bringing both quantitative and qualitative research methods to bear, and unearthed an important set of insights. We fielded a survey to over 1000 sales reps from 23B to B companies across all kinds of industries. We tested over 90 sales Rep attributes and behaviors, all related to getting in early with customers. Then we conducted over 100 structured interviews with sales reps, managers and leaders, all with an eye to understanding what separates high performers from average performers when it comes to getting in early. The single most powerful behavior separating high performers from core performers is using social media as a critical channel to engage customers and generate leads. What exactly does it mean to use social media in the context of getting in early? Well, when you unpack the data, it comes down to three things. One connecting with potential customers. Two, using social networks like LinkedIn and Twitter to share points of view valuable to customers. Three, using social media for lead generation. When we talked to a number of sales reps having huge success with this approach, what we found is this all adds up to positioning oneself as a key influencer within social networks. To do that, we found the best reps worked very hard to tap into a large social network extending far beyond personal contacts and current customers. These reps are accessing the entire ecosystem of the marketplace that that Rep sells into. So not just existing customers, but potential customers. Even people who might never be your customer, but could potentially buy your product in another territory through a different channel or through another supplier altogether. But that's just the beginning. Then there are channel partners, industry experts, market influencers, complementary suppliers, influencers from similar or adjacent industries, you name it. Basically, it's anyone and everyone who might be interested in engaging in a conversation around the broadest set of issues your products and services potentially touch. So the best reps Find the watering holes or those online communities where people in their industry gather and learn. In advanced cases, the very best reps will serve as teaching connectors, serving as a hub, bringing this group of people together in order to engage in a learning conversation around a common interest. Done well, sales reps who play this role as Teaching Connector are much more likely to attract mobilizers into their orbit. Now there are clearly ways that refuse of social media can go wrong. The best reps who are involved in social media are very careful how they use it. The last thing star performers would do with this powerful network they've tapped into is use it to broadcast messages with no interaction or teaching. In other words, using it purely as an advertising channel. Yet we see far too much of social selling happening in exactly this way. No one has any patience for posts like. Just wanted to let you know our new XP Nine 100 is out next month pre-order today. We've all been on the receiving end of this kind of message on LinkedIn. That's not what this channel is for. Rather, it's about actively engaging in a productive, interesting conversation. Ideally, conversation that teaches. It fits right into the spark introduced Confront model from Chapter 6. Social watering holes are the ideal place to spark a target audience into exploring your ideas by sharing surprising data, insights and provocative viewpoints. Because commercial insights are by definition not about you as a supplier, but about customers, they are much less likely to be rejected on the grounds of being commercially slanted. One star performing sales Rep we talked to in the healthcare space summed it up nicely, she told us. You've got to weave yourself into the knowledge fabric where your customers learn, but you've got to earn that right. You've got to help the customer think differently than they would have otherwise. Now in some industries, there are more social watering holes and opportunities for our customers and ecosystem partners to learn and engage in conversations. There are some regulated spaces like healthcare and financial services where social media growth has been stunted. But we've been consistently surprised at how far and wide social watering holes are extending to some B to B categories where you'd never expect it. Chemistry. Check. Material science? Yep. Auto dealership finance and insurance? Uh-huh. We're seeing leading marketing and sales functions tag team to get this right. Suppliers like IBM, Cisco, National Instruments and others are blazing the trail here. When it comes to social media, marketers complain that it's difficult to scale efforts there because social media is so time and labor intensive. Well, these organizations realize that in sales they have multiple times the people power that marketing can bring to bear. We view this kind of social enablement as a critical part of the larger commercial strategy to teach mobilizers and disrupt their mental models early, ideally when they are passively learning, but certainly before the 57% point when they are picking up the phone to talk to a sales Rep. Teach where and when customers learn. Implication #4 Managing blockers. There are times and situations where a purchase bogs down. Where a stakeholder is so incredibly entrenched in their own views and won't budge. As we covered earlier in this book, we affectionately call these fine folks blockers, though chances are good your sales teams use far more colorful language to describe them. Blockers readily derail consensus building and collective learning efforts, spoiling any chance of a new view emerging. When we've interviewed sellers on how to best engage a blocker, a litany of hilarious responses usually ensued. Get them fired or football tickets or humiliate them are among our favorites. Perhaps there is a time and place for any of those actions, but invariably the number one response we heard is ignore them. For years, the conventional wisdom has been to avoid blockers altogether, like an ostrich burying its head in the sand, hoping they will somehow disappear. However, there is one problem with that strategy. Blockers don't go away or stay on the sidelines. They are present, either knowingly or unknowingly, in virtually every deal. Depending on their influence, blockers have a powerful ability to stall and derail the most promising of deals. Fortunately, across the course of our research, we've identified a number of proven, proactive strategies to address and neutralize deal blockers. As a reminder, a blocker is a customer stakeholder who tries to prevent a supplier from closing a deal, whether because they dislike the supplier, prefer a competing supplier, or want to maintain the status quo. Like the mobilizer, blockers don't fall into any pattern of seniority, buying role or functional role. Unfortunately, they come in all shapes and sizes with different influencing levels. Making matters worse, the blocker isn't necessarily even known to the supplier. They could be known, unknown, or even what we would call stealth blockers. Those who vocalize support to the salesperson but then turn around and torpedo the deal behind the scenes. With the inclusion of one or more blockers in any given deal, a supplier's chances of making a high quality sale decrease by 47%. As you well know, blockers are present in virtually every deal. Therefore logic would say that from the get go for most deals, you have only a 53% chance of making a high quality sale. Scary stuff. As most sales managers will attest, salespeople rarely engage blockers effectively. Most salespeople ignore the blockers who are lying in wait to undermine their deals, hoping that they can rally enough support to overrule a blockers objections. We've observed the best sales managers quite literally forced discussion of blockers amongst their sales teams. These sales managers are taught to ask questions like if I told you we were overlooking a blocker to this deal, who would you guess it would be and why? The wording alone is smart. The question doesn't allow the seller to say that there are no blockers. They can't default to their natural tendency, in other words. Another powerful question used by managers is what types of stakeholders typically block deals like this. A great question for prompting the seller to think about similar deals and where there might be common blocker tendencies. Blockers are tricky stakeholders and they will state objections that they think will align with other stakeholders. Objections as they don't want to be seen as explicitly rocking the boat. This makes it hard to uncover a blocker's true concerns. Good managers will ask more straightforward questions like has the blocker had any negative interactions with us in the past? But he or she will also layer in questions that dig at potential underlying concerns like. How could this purchase make the blockers work more difficult? Finally, good sales managers will commit to a plan for managing the blocker. The goal here is to address the salespersons tendency to delay interactions with blockers. What is our strategy for dealing with the blocker prompts action from the sales team? OK, so how do you manage blockers? The first question sellers should ask themselves is can the blocker be persuaded by the supporters in the stakeholder group? In other words, can social pressure be applied to neutralize the blocker? Can they be influenced by mobilizers and other supporters within the stakeholder group? If the answer is yes, you want to apply social pressure through collective learning. As we discussed in this chapter, collective learning involves the exploration of objections, concerns and uncertainties among stakeholders surfacing disconnects, and competing viewpoints. Each of these actions is designed to get everyone on the same page, including the blocker. You're hoping to turn the blocker into a supporter, or at the very least mitigate or decrease their influence on the collective group. In addition to creating a collective learning interaction, these social pressures can be used to counteract a blocker. Conducting a workshop or other event where stakeholders can exchange views with the blocker. Identifying influencers that the blocker respects and having your mobilizer, broker and interaction. Arming your mobilizer or other influencers with information to convince the blocker to support the deal. Encouraging influencers to share why others are supporting the deal. In our research, we found that collective learning decreases likelihood of encountering a blocker by 20%. Further, there is a 35% increase in the likelihood of making a high quality sale when collective learning occurs within a stakeholder group that has a blocker. That's an extremely significant jump and underscores the importance of collective learning. The reason we try this tactic first is not only is it hugely effective, but also it's the lowest risk of all the tactics. Social pressure doesn't carry terribly high stakes. Sure, the blocker might get annoyed if colleagues want them to stand down, but that's about the worst outcome. What explains this impact? Engaging in collective learning creates a larger proportion of supporters in the stakeholder group, reducing the proportion of both neutrals and blockers, in turn reducing the impact of the remaining blockers. Blockers may still exist despite high collective learning. So if applying social pressure through collective learning does not turn or minimize the influence of the blocker, what do we do next? The second question that the seller should ask themselves is does the blocker seem reasonable and approachable? If yes, then the sellers should attempt to communicate through tailored dialogue to persuade the blocker to allow the deal to move forward. Note that we are not yet at the stage where we want to be making concessions. We will get to that in a moment. Different motivating factors drive different types of blocker behaviors. Some want to avoid change, some want the competition to win the business, and some simply want to see you lose the business. One of the blocker types, the Pro Status Quo Blocker, is best engaged by listening to and empathizing with their concerns regarding change. First, show that you understand their concerns, but also later reinforce the risks of not changing, creating urgency for the offering. You can also offer to connect them to previous or existing customers who had similar concerns. For the pro competitor blocker type, you should engage them in discussing the main motivation for making a purchase in general agnostic of supplier. Then explain how you can help them achieve their goals in a way that other suppliers cannot. For the anti supplier blocker type, you should engage by asking them to lay out their honest thoughts about you as a supplier, no matter how brutal. Acknowledge the truth in their perspective and share how you are committed to addressing and making up for your past mistakes. Take note that direct engagement tactics carry greater risk. The chances of the blocker taking a personal disliking towards you increase, and that's baggage no one wants to carry within a deal. But if social pressure failed to work, you may need to resort to this tactic. So what do you do if your blockers are not reasonable or approachable? Or if your efforts to communicate fall short? At this point, it's now time to think about making a concession. The third question that the sellers should ask as part of the progression is does the blocker have concerns about a specific aspect of the offering? If the answer is yes, consider making a targeted concession. Alter the deal to make it appealing, but not entirely commercially damaging to your organization. Now, concessions are tricky and by no means does this approach provide an exhaustive set of guidance for concessions or negotiation, but we can provide some general guidelines to follow when considering and developing concessions. First, thoroughly plan ahead and identify negotiable and non negotiable aspects of the deal. This knowledge is crucial for how you formulate your concession strategy. Second, take those negotiable aspects and hypothesize which aspects the blocker will react positively to and be more inclined to accept. Third, when developing the concession, you obviously want to concede as little as possible for your own benefit, but furthermore want to ensure that you do not endanger your support from other stakeholders because of a now watered down or no longer worthwhile solution. 4th To the earlier point, you need to get explicit support for this new vision of the deal from our set of supportive stakeholders. 5th Practicing good negotiating hygiene. Secure a guarantee from the blocker and other supporters that the deal will go through based on the new vision, preventing further concessions and further delays. You want to ensure that all the work that went in the concession leads to results, otherwise you have wasted time. And money. Again, you've stepped up the level of risk by altering the deal. It's possible that collateral damage is now done and chances are good that you've had to remove something versus making the deal bigger. Active trade-offs are now being made and that's definitely more risky for your commercial outcomes. If you get to the point where making a concession does not work, you then need to go to the final and last option. Escalate. The question you're sellers should ask themselves at this point is do senior leaders at the customer organization have an interest in this deal closing? If yes, you want to leverage someone more senior than the blocker to help grease the wheels and encourage the blocker to allow the deal to push forward. This is clearly the riskiest option and carries significant political ramifications for the blocker. It may potentially endanger their job or career path. Going over the top of the blocker and escalating is certainly a last resort type of option. To that end, let's take a look at some of the action steps and guidelines for the escalation strategy. First, contact one of the blockers leaders and explain the situation. But pick carefully. You'll want to pick a leader who you think can professionally manage the situation and would be receptive to escalation. Someone who can be trusted with mitigating the potential awkwardness of the situation. Second, ensure the leader understands the blockers motivations. Don't just approach them and say Johnny is not playing nice. You want to avoid making this an attack on the blocker. Provide the leader with a balanced perspective so they can judge and take action accordingly and professionally. Third, and this is contingent on steps one and two, if the blocker continues to stall the deal, you can ask the leader to overrule the blockers influence. Now this has the greatest potential for some scorched earth, and we would certainly view this as a last resort tactic. You obviously have to take into account the blockers influence for future deals and account growth. In parallel with all of those steps, it is paramount that you keep our supporters at the customer organization informed and in the loop to avoid concern around the deal, but also to continue the collective pressure that they might be able to exert on the blocker, either explicitly or implicitly. What happens if this strategy fails? At this point, you then have to seriously consider whether you want to actively pursue this opportunity any longer. Is it worth it? Does it still make business sense? That decision is going to depend on the nuances of your business and the type of deal. But in general, our view is that if a deal gets to this point, it's best to put it on the back burner, passively pursue and focus elsewhere. Just to recap, remember. Blockers cannot and should not be ignored. Their impact is immense and as we state here, blockers reduce the likelihood of making a high quality deal by 47%. Managers play a critical role. They can help lessen the likelihood of a blocker obstructing a deal by forcing sellers to identify blockers and conceive engagement strategies early on. You can minimize a blockers impact and influence, but you can't necessarily eliminate it altogether. Collective learning minimizes A blockers impact, but more aggressive engagement strategies may still be needed. The importance of collective learning can't be understated in today's consensus driven purchase, where divergent views and dysfunction reigns supreme and deals get compressed and compressed to the lowest common denominator. It's the means by which we can help our mobilizers forge a purchase decision. It brings diverse stakeholders, including blockers and procurement, together to make a meaningful decision. Implication #5. Sales Process and Opportunity Planning. Buying made easy. The challenges of today's customer purchase experience have been highlighted throughout this book. If there is one take away you should have from all the research and best practices shared to this point, it's this. Commercial organizations need to place far greater emphasis on supporting the customer's purchase process. One of our all time classic best practices comes from an organization that has done just that and shifted their entire sales process to more of a purchase enablement process. The company is ADP, the global payroll and human Capital Management firm, and this is their buying made easy purchase process. At first glance, ADP's approach might look a lot like your run-of-the-mill sales process. On closer examination, however, you'll realize this is very different. The first thing you'll notice is that ADP doesn't have a sales process at all. This is actually a very structured approach to moving deals through a customers buying process. This is precisely why ADP refers to this approach as buying Made Easy. This entire approach is designed to support the customer through a series of customer outcomes throughout a typical purchase experience. How most companies design A sales process, of course, is by mapping out the activities known to drive commercial success. Sellers are then expected to execute those activities as effectively and efficiently as possible. The idea being that if sellers do these things in this order, the chances of the customer purchasing are maximized. But what ADP is doing is different. From their perspective, the real question isn't how do we help our reps better sell, but rather how can our sales teams help our customer better buy. This process is predicated upon the major decision stages that nearly any customer will undergo, including one recognizing a need.

      "Content: Chapter 2. The mobilizer.  In many ways, the question of who to target as a supplier is as old as sales itself. On the marketing side, the question comes back to the very core of the profession, market segmentation in all its various forms by geography, industry, strategic fit, customer behavior, psychographic attributes, you name it. On the sales side, perhaps somewhat less scientifically, the question often boils down to a particular sales methodology or recent training program, or just as likely, these specific guidance from a sales manager based on his or her 30 years of experience selling in this industry. Irrespective of function or methodology, however, what none of these approaches prioritize in a formal manner is any systematic thought around who to target across the customer organization in order to build a bridge to the other 4.4. That's not necessarily a criticism, simply a recognition of the fact that the world has changed, if not the world of selling, then at the very least the world of buying. A consensus oriented approach to stakeholder management wasn't as important just a few short years ago when senior decision makers could be counted on more reliably to get the deal done on their own. Given the group buying dynamics we laid out earlier, however, today's sales and marketing executives will have to think far more precisely about who to target as a best candidate across the 5.4 to drive the kind of consensus most likely to get suppliers paid. But who to choose? It turns out that's a really interesting question. Boiling the ocean - The CEB sales and marketing team has spent several years building what is arguably one of the world's largest and most unique data sets around the topic of complex selling. As part of this effort, we ran four separate research initiatives to help us answer the question, how does star sellers win the consensus based sale? Two of those projects focused on sales Rep performance and two focused on customer buying behavior. The former started with an expansive study of sales Rep behaviors and beliefs, collecting data from more than 1000 star and core performers from over 40 companies. In that survey, we ask reps to assess their views and behaviors across everything from opportunity qualification to process execution to stakeholder engagement. All geared toward painting as accurate a picture as possible of what suppliers best reps do on a day-to-day basis to set themselves apart. This study was all about the actual motion of a star performer deal. As always, we built the study to ensure representation across the major industries, geographies and go to market models within the CEB sales membership. Importantly, we made sure that we weren't biasing our results by surveying just sales reps known to be challengers. While we know many companies are aggressively pursuing the Challenger model, we wanted to ensure that we were casting as broad a net as possible and that the ensuing results would apply to all companies and sales leaders, not just those who've adopted the Challenger approach. That being said, when you see the results, you'll find, perhaps not surprisingly, heavy overtones of the Challenger profile in what stars are doing. Once we have the data back from our Rep survey, we also ran a number of structured interviews with star performers to corroborate the findings and hear directly from the best about what they're doing so differently. And these conversations proved fascinating. At the same time, we also conducted two major customer studies. First, because we were studying customer consensus, we ran a survey across roughly 600 individual stakeholders inside B2B customer organizations in order to figure out just how team based purchase decisions are made. Who's involved and how they operate? Second, we conducted a separate survey of over 700 individual customer stakeholders involved in B2B purchases. This latter study was specifically built to determine whether certain stakeholders are naturally better than others when it comes to driving change and building consensus across their organizations. We qualified the respondents by screening out those who did not have previous experience with sophisticated purchases and those who worked for smaller organizations fewer than 1000 employees. For those respondents who met these criteria, we asked them to complete a 135 question survey about the actual purchase experience. These four studies produced a huge amount of data and it took some time to sift through it. But when you step back and take it all in at once, what you find is dramatic. Star reps are running a completely different playbook, one designed to build consensus and not just find it. For our marketing readers, working backward from high quality deals and what star performers do to win them holds crucial lessons for what we do in upstream marketing activities, from value prop construction to demand generation to messaging. The new High Performance Playbook. There's an old saying in sales that echoes the recent move to B2P marketing. People don't sell to companies, people sell to people. Customer engagement is the true heart and soul of sales, and marketing always has been. At the end of the day, you've got to sit down with the customer, look them in the eye and try to win their business. It's part art and part science, but either way, it's that magical moment where everything comes together. All the training, all the coaching, all the tools. You've got to run a conversation with an actual person who at the very least, moves that deal forward. What we found in the data suggests that when it comes to those conversations, stars are not only talking about completely different things in different ways, as we profiled in our Challenger work, but just as important, they're talking to completely different people. While it is true, in other words, that people sell to people, it is equally true that star reps don't seek out just any people. They're just as deliberate about who they sell to as how they sell to them. But before we look at who those people are, let's first turn to people they were most likely told to find. A conventional approach to customer engagement. If there's one thing suppliers would likely agree on, it's that at some point in the sale you've got to find and get in front of the senior decision maker to get the deal done. So much of A rep's time in a sale is typically spent tracking down the people who can grant them access to that person. But in the painful reality of today's complex solution sale, those physics of the traditional sale no longer hold true. In fact, in a survey of senior decision makers across several hundred companies, the central target of this traditional approach, we found that the number one thing they care about most in choosing one supplier over another is whether or not that supplier enjoys widespread support across the customer organization. In other words, the number one thing senior decision makers care about in a complex deal isn't the supplier company solution. It's their own companies buy in. And that makes a lot of sense when you stop to think about it. Who wants to spend potentially millions on the implementation of a new solution only to find out that everyone's against it? That's a recipe for disaster and significantly reduced tenure. So as companies have shifted to selling ever more complex solutions to customers, not surprisingly, decision makers have been ever more wary of going it alone. As a result, we now live in a world where even when a Rep does the hard work of clawing his way up to the corner office and makes a powerful, compelling pitch to the senior decision maker, that conversation still ends with something like. This looks great. I'm excited to partner with you. But before we can get this done, I just need you to go talk to this person, this person, this person and this person, and then I think we're good to go. And that's tough. That's a deal now in significant danger of stalling, despite the support of the person who typically, one would argue, matters most. Long gone are the days where reps could use advocates to get access to the people who truly matter, then go win them over to get the deal done. In a world of consensus building, everyone matters. There may still be a single economic buyer or ultimate decision maker, but it's a team based purchase nonetheless. So now what? After all, salespeople still need to go out and talk to someone. But whom? Who should suppliers tell their salespeople to target first in a 5.4 world? What are most companies doing now? To find out, we spoke with over 100 sales leaders, heads of sales operations and leaders of sales training around the world, asking how they train their reps on stakeholder management. We learned that the attributes suppliers tell their salespeople to look for in an ideal customer stakeholder are remarkably consistent. Whether we call this ideal stakeholder an advocate, a champion or a coach, the conventional wisdom out there is that we need to engage with somebody inside the customer organization who can provide guidance on how purchase decisions are made and who, ideally is willing to help us navigate that process. We tell our sales reps to look for stakeholders who are readily accessible. We need someone willing to meet and talk with us. We also tell our reps that we want somebody who can provide valuable information typically unavailable to suppliers. For instance, somebody who can provide the inside scoop on the political environment within the customer organization or useful intelligence on how the purchase process will really unfold. And obviously we want a stakeholder who's predisposed to support our solution over the competitions offering. It would be an added benefit if this person were good at influencing his or her colleagues to win them over to our side. To do this, they typically need to be seen as credible by others, and of course they need to be convincing in articulating the business case for the purchase. We also guide our reps to look for stakeholders who are truthful and reliable. All of these other compelling traits are for not if they don't speak the truth to us or their colleagues, and if they can't be relied on to follow through on their commitments. Ideally, we'd also like this stakeholder to have some skin in the game. After all, an advocate is much more likely to help if they stand to profit themselves. And finally, we'd want somebody willing to network that Rep with other stakeholders to make introductions to other influential folks, in particular the ultimate decision maker. Piece of cake. This is a daunting list of attributes. Wouldn't it just be easier to make an end run to the final decision maker herself? While logically that approach seems more straightforward, it's still going to wind up in the same place when that decision maker just sends reps out to build the widespread support she requires in order to make a decision. What we're looking for isn't just somebody who can help get us into the corner office. We want somebody who can help make our case all over the company, laterally and vertically. This is why a list of attributes like this can get so long. Indeed, that long list of attributes represents the inherited conventional wisdom from years of solution selling passed down from veteran to rookie and manager to team across at least the last couple of decades. And honestly, it's hard to argue that any of these things don't apply. After all, who wouldn't want a customer stakeholder who did all of these things? But there's only one problem. When we comb through all of our data from all of our research to find this individual, what we discovered is. They don't exist. Now, to be fair, each of these attributes can likely be found somewhere across the wide range of stakeholders in any given customer organization, but virtually never all in one person. Why does that matter? Because as we've told our own sellers, people sell to people they don't sell to attributes. So when core reps are working from a list like this, whether it's in their heads or in a training manual, they don't view a list like this as a collection of discrete characteristics. What they likely see is the description of a real person. As a result, they spend a huge amount of time out there hunting for someone who can't be found because they don't actually exist. But practically speaking, at some point, of course they have to make a choice. They've got to talk to somebody. Since they can't find someone with all these traits, they have to settle for someone who has at least some of these traits. But which ones should they prioritize? Are some better than others when it comes to driving business? How can they tell? How can they be sure? Without any more guidance, core reps are left to guess on their own. But think about how difficult that choice is going to be. Asking sales reps to go out and find this ideal advocate or coach in nature is like giving them a net, sending them into the forest and saying bring me back a Unicorn. It's just not going to happen. Now, sales reps at any level are endlessly creative, and most won't come back empty handed. But at the very best, they're going to come back with either a large goat or maybe a skinny rhino. It'll have four legs and a horn, but it won't be the same thing. Because unicorns don't exist either. In their sincere effort to get that choice right, we find that core reps inadvertently get it exactly wrong, eventually walking right past the very people star performers consistently rely on to get the deal done. Seven flavors of customer stakeholders. In our analysis of over 700 customer stakeholders across hundreds of customer organizations, we asked respondents to assess themselves across 135 different stakeholder attributes, traits, and perspectives. Then, using a statistical technique called factor analysis, we were able to take that data and derive a set of discrete stakeholder profiles. And finally, we were then able to determine the relative ability of individuals in each profile to drive concrete action around a large scale corporate purchase or initiative. What does all that mean? In a nutshell, we wanted to know two things from this analysis. First, we wanted a data-driven understanding of what kinds of customers are out there in the first place, something more reliable than the gut feel list we saw earlier. And second, we wanted a better understanding of how effective each kind of customer is at building consensus and driving change. What we found is eye opening. When all the math was done, we discovered that customers fall into one of seven discreet stakeholder types across a typical B to B sale. As was the case in our Challenger research, in which we found five distinct Rep profiles, we'd emphasize here that these seven types aren't necessarily mutually exclusive. In reality, most people tend to share at least some attributes across these boundaries. That's only natural. But nonetheless, what the data clearly indicate is that virtually every customer has a primary posture when it comes to both working with suppliers and driving change across their organization. Let's take just a minute to go through each of these different stakeholder types to better understand what makes each of them unique. As we do, chances are that you'll recognize each from your own experience in working with your own customers. Then ask yourself as you listen to the descriptions of each which of these customer stakeholders would you seek out and which would you avoid? The first profile we found is the Go getter. This person is all about organizational improvement. He's constantly looking for good ideas and champions them when he finds them, no matter where they come from. What's more, he delivers results. This person is the project manager, the pragmatist, the one who immediately starts translating new opportunities into work plans, key deliverables, implementation milestones, and success metrics. When sitting down with the go getter, he will immediately focus on the how of what you're proposing as opposed to the why of what you're proposing. Next we have the skeptic. In contrast to the Go getter, the skeptic is more focused on the why behind a change proposal and will hold a high bar in terms of burden of proof. The skeptic pushes back on everything, and will often start from the assumption that the change you're talking about isn't going to go as planned. The one whose first reaction to a new idea or opportunity is let me explain why that isn't going to work here. Or, you know, the last time we tried something like this, it took twice as long, cost twice as much, and delivered half the benefit we expected. Mind you, it's not because he's annoying, but because he's wary of large, complicated projects and tends to take a glass half empty perspective on the benefits of a given solution as described by the salesperson. It's typically not because the skeptic finds the salesperson deceitful, but rather because he doubts his organization can fully realize the benefits of the change. As a result, the skeptic tends to need a lot of convincing and is especially careful to lay the groundwork and set expectations in order to ensure a successful measured implementation. The friend is the third profile we found. Just as nice as they sound, the friend is readily accessible to reps and willingly networks reps with other stakeholders across the organization. These folks always make time to meet with outside salespeople. Whether out of professional courtesy or a genuine interest in expanding their own networks. They are characterized by an openness and willingness to make time for meeting with salespeople. Whereas the vast majority of customers never respond to emails or voicemails left by salespeople, the friend would never design to be so inconsiderate. 4th We have the teacher. The teacher is all about sharing insights and ideas. Colleagues seek him out for his advice and input. He's good at convincing others to pursue a course of action. Because of their unique storytelling and communication abilities, these people are frequently tapped to help senior leadership craft their own messages. They are the Blue Ocean strategy folks within the customer organization. They love to paint a bold, aggressive vision and see others get as enthused about it as they are. Passion and excitement are the currency of the teacher. After the teacher we have the guide. The guide willingly provides information typically unavailable outside the customer organization. Their stock in trade is information, plain and simple. They use the information, especially confidential, privileged information, to enhance the perception others have of them. The thinking being that if others see them as in the know, they'll perceive them as being more senior and important than perhaps the title on their business card suggests. Because of this their best thought of as the over shares of the customer organization. The ones who dished the dirt and catch you up on the latest comings and goings of various players inside the company, often sharing information about colleagues and internal politics that makes outsiders a bit uneasy. Next we have the climber. The climber is focused almost entirely on personal gain. These are the skin in the game. Stakeholders who actively back projects that raise their profile, increase their influence, or expand their fiefdoms. When they back a project or initiative, they do so out of the belief that if it goes well, they will be rewarded for their success. The climber also likes to brag about past successes and accomplishments. Finally, we have what might be considered the anti stakeholder. The blocker. These individuals are wired to avoid change and defend the status quo. They strongly prefer stability and continuity, actively avoiding and preventing initiatives that would bring change and disruption. As a result, they rarely help suppliers and almost never go out of their way to speak to outside vendors. Whether they block for personal reasons, for example being burned by suppliers in the past or being the person who invented the legacy system or approach. Or because they are pro status quo, it makes little difference. While it's critical to identify and manage blockers, something we'll talk about later in the book, for the sake of this discussion we need to throw them out of the mix. Because of how they're wired, they will never be the stakeholder A salesperson will hitch their wagon to. These are the seven customer profiles we find in nature. We're guessing that if you were to think back across the last few deals your company has sold or attempted to sell, you could probably put a customer name against each of the profiles you heard here. But while it's a convenient shorthand for thinking about different types of stakeholders, here's the real kicker. The attributes we shared earlier in this chapter, the 10 things we tell our reps to look for when finding an advocate or coach, are more or less evenly spread across these seven customer profiles. Think about what that means in practical terms for core performing sales reps. If they're looking for a single person who embodies all of those shaded attributes, they're going to be looking for a long time. Not because these attributes can't be found, but because the data tell us that it's extremely rare to find them all, or even more than a few for that matter, in the same person. Now, one might argue that since these profiles are not necessarily mutually exclusive, technically, it is possible to stumble across someone who embodies the whole list. But frankly, that's not very realistic. In fact, we did the math and we determined that the full combination of ideal stakeholder attributes coexists in the same person less than 1% of the time. That's fewer than seven out of 700 people in our survey. That might not be as rare as finding a Unicorn, but it may as well be. After all, how much time do you want your core Rep spending running from account to account, searching high and low for the small handful of people? That represents all of the ideal stakeholder attributes we tell them are important. Thankfully, in the real world, that's not what actually happens. So what does happen? Here's where the story gets really fascinating. Among the seven profiles to be found, it turns out that core reps and star reps target in nearly opposite directions. To show you what we mean, let's first do a quick thought exercise. Go back and look at those seven profiles again. If we were to tell you that star performers focus on building strong relationships with three of these profiles in particular, which three do you think those would be? Next, if we were to tell you that core performers also gravitate to a certain three, which do you think those would be? Here's a hint. There is no overlap at all between the profiles core reps target and the one star reps target. In neither case do they target the blocker, because as you'll recall, this person is very anti change and extremely difficult for a sales Rep to engage. As a supplier, even if you wanna talk to them, they don't wanna talk to you. The mobilizers. As we dug into the Rep data, here's what we found. One of the things we tested in great detail were the attributes sales reps seek out when prioritizing one customer stakeholder over another. Reps were presented with a long list of potential stakeholder characteristics. Things like easily accessible. Budget owner, senior title and willing to share information. We then asked them to rate the importance that each of those characteristics on a scale from one to seven in terms of the relative importance in seeking out the stakeholders best suited to help them advance a sale. We then took those responses and cut them by sales Rep performance level to determine which attributes stood out as most important to star performers. The results were surprising. It turns out star performers by and large, care about two things far above all others when determining who they're going to rely on to move a deal forward. Relatively less important to stars are things like seniority, sea level title, budget ownership, decision making, authority. Namely, all the traditional attributes most might assume to be at the top of their list. Instead, star sellers are looking for customer stakeholders who can one drive change across their organization and to build consensus among their colleagues. These two attributes alone accounted for the vast majority of star Rep attention in prioritizing 1 stakeholder over another. Even more interesting, it's highly unlikely that anyone ever trained them to do this. They just figured it out on their own overtime. They've discovered, whether consciously or subconsciously, that in a 5.4 world, the ability to build consensus and Dr. change stands above all others in predicting the value of a stakeholder in getting a solutions deal done. Now that's a hugely valuable finding, because it then allowed us to return to the seven stakeholder profiles we found in the data and ask a very simple but powerful question. Who among these seven profiles is particularly good at building consensus and driving change? To figure that out, we carefully tested each of the seven profiles against their likelihood and ability to drive organizational action. Specifically, the likelihood and ability to initiate change and drive agreement around complex purchases and changes. In practical terms, what this means is that we measured each respondent's ability to drive consensus in a complex deal. To be clear, we didn't just ask people how good they thought they were at driving change and consensus. After all, most everyone thinks they do that well. Instead, we let the analysis figure that out by creating a special index score for each respondent based on their reactions to a series of situational judgment scenarios presented in the survey. These scenarios were designed to represent typical business situations in which you, as a stakeholder, had to choose a role to play with respect to potential solutions, purchases, organizational changes, and large scale initiatives. There were a wide variety of possible responses, for instance. I'd support the change if it benefited me personally. Or I'd support the change if the project plan made sense. Or I'd work to maintain the status quo and minimize the scope of the proposed change. Respondents would pick which posture best characterized how they would engage around the initiative, an exercise that was repeated multiple times to determine a specific person's given proclivity. This method gave us a much more objective measurement of an individual's true likelihood to drive change and allowed us to measure real differences across stakeholders. Who, had we simply asked them the direct question, more than likely would have all told us they're great at driving change. When we ran that analysis and then married it back to the sales Rep data mentioned earlier, what we found is high performing reps focus on building connections with go getters, teachers and skeptics, while average performing salespeople target guides, friends and climbers. So while it is true that people sell to people, it turns out that core and star performers don't just sell differently to the same people, they actually sell differently to different people. It's not so much that this happens that makes this data so intriguing. Rather, it's the why. It turns out that the go getter, the teacher, and the skeptic are fantastic at driving consensus based change. The Go getter because she's looking to champion great ideas that can be turned into tangible business results. The teacher, because he can paint a vision that will build momentum for new ideas. The skeptic, while more cautious, will carefully look something over and then push for change in bite size increments. Far and away, these are the key people making things happen inside any organization. In fact, moving forward will refer to these three stakeholders, go getters, teachers, and skeptics as mobilizers, because that's what they are. They are the ones who mobilize the organization to act, the ones who forge consensus, the architects and champions for change. Meanwhile, we have the three profiles that core performers target. The guide, the friend, and the climber, each of whom has relatively little impact on organizational change. They are very interested in talking, but much less so in acting. For short, we'll call them the Talkers. This distinction between mobilizers and talkers raises an important question. If you're selling a large, complex, disruptive solution into a company characterized by these seven stakeholder types. Who should you be talking to, Mobilizers or talkers? Indeed, if you think back to how high and core performing reps map to this framework, you begin to see just how important this finding really is. Core reps sell to talkers and fail, while stars sell to mobilizers and win. It's the key to winning the consensus based sale. It's not just that people sell to people. It said good people sell to the right people and the difference here can be huge. In fact, when we went back to our sales Rep performance analysis, we found that sales reps who engage mobilizers are 31% more likely to be a high performer than those who don't. When you dig into these profiles in a bit more detail, you begin to see why. Remember our core performer looking for a Unicorn? Unable to find all ten Advocate attributes in a single person, who's he going to latch on to? Well, if you're a core performer, the easy thing to do is find someone who wants to talk to you, namely a guide or a friend. They're fantastic because they're friendly, open and accessible. Not just that, but in the case of the guide, they're willing to share information. What's not to like? But if your goal is to get a sale and not just have a good conversation, the data very clearly suggests that these people can't get you very far. Star performers are out looking for a different kind of conversation altogether. Take another look at the mobilizers. What do they all have in common? Well, to put it bluntly, none of them are necessarily looking to talk to you. These people are focused on getting things done. They're constantly pushing their companies and themselves to think and act differently. In the words of one impressive star performer we interviewed as part of our research. You've got to have more than someone to talk to. You need someone willing to own the vision and make things happen. What you need, in other words, is a mobilizer. It can be downright unpleasant, if not terrifying. First of all, it's naturally focused on the company's challenge, not the Rep solution. So it requires more than being a good talking brochure in the meeting. It requires that you can engage at a meaningful level on real issues of importance to the customer. You're also going to face a ton of questions when you talk to these people. Go Getters will press you because they want to do, teachers because they want to know, and skeptics because they want to test. Skeptics in particular are going to pull an idea apart piece by piece and examine it from every possible angle before grudgingly providing their support. And for core performers, that's a conversation many would rather avoid altogether. Yet for stars, it's the best possible reason to get out of bed every morning. Depending on your perspective, it's either the worst or the very best sales conversation you'll have all year. Going head to head with a skeptical customer on a new idea. Tearing it down and then building it back up specifically in the context of that customer's unique business challenges. Who wants to have that kind of conversation? Well, it turns out your stars do. In part because this is the sort of hand to hand combat they live for. But more important, because they see mobilizers for who they are, stakeholders they can rely on to drive meaningful progress and ultimately get the deal done. As one high performer said to us in an interview. If they're not skeptical and don't push me, then I've done something wrong or they're just not serious. How many of our core performers think that way? If you step back from this data and think about what's going on here, we're guessing you probably see the same thing we do. When you think about your very best reps, your challenger reps, it's no surprise that they're naturally drawn to mobilizers. Because mobilizers are just like them. They are the challengers of the customer organization. Meanwhile, the relationship builder sales Rep As you'll recall, this was the Rep focused on identifying and acquiescing to customer demands and according to our data, the Rep least likely to be a star performer. We'll naturally gravitate to talkers, because talkers are just like them. They are the relationship builders of the customer organization. They're likable and generous with their time. But nothing ever seems to get done. Core reps don't choose talkers because they're confused. They choose talkers because it's easy. But it turns out that talkers are just as bad at getting the deal done on the customer side as relationship builders are on the supplier side. One head of sales we work with summed it up this way. Challengers sell to challengers and relationship builders sell to relationship builders. Each looks for its twin within the customer organization. And this is the person they will hitch their wagon to. This is how your stars build consensus rather than just find it. They're specifically targeting the people best positioned to create consensus in the first place, to help them climb the ME to WE mountain. Three keys to unlocking mobilizer potential. Having studied mobilizers and their role in the customer buying process for the better part of five years, we've come to conclude that suppliers must get three things right in order to fully unlock mobilizer potential. One Suppliers must teach mobilizers where they learn. Two, suppliers must tailor their engagement efforts to specific mobilizer type. Three, suppliers must equip their mobilizers to take control of the consensus building process. Why Teach Taylor and take control? The framework for this book, Teach Taylor and Take Control, will feel familiar to readers of the Challenger sale. We see three specific reasons for using the same framework to unpack our mobilizer research. First, this book is the mirror image of Challenger. You'll recall from the very first pages that this is a book about buying solutions as opposed to selling them. It's about customer challengers as opposed to challenger salespeople. So it stands to reason that the same framework would apply just from a customer perspective rather than a supplier perspective. In many respects, this book is about the customer reaction to our challenger actions. Second, it helps support ongoing change management efforts. No commercial leader who has taken the plunge on Challenger wants or needs a new and potentially different framework distracting the organization from the hard change management work at hand. As we discussed in the Challenger sale, adopting this new commercial approach isn't something that happens overnight. The change is difficult and progress is measured in months and years as opposed to weeks and days. For most organizations, they still have not fully digested the first wave of change from Challenger. Dropping a new competing framework into the mix under serves all parties, salespeople, managers, marketers, CSO, CMO's, you name it. Our goal isn't to make things more difficult. It's to make it easier for organizations pursuing the Challenger model to adopt these new mobilizer insights. We'll be taking listeners much deeper into the ideas of teaching, tailoring and taking control than we did in the Challenger sale. We'll provide more data, analysis, perspective and guidance to those companies already on the journey, and in some cases provide additional data to those leaders still on the fence about whether a challenger approach makes sense for their organizations. In that respect, think of this as the 2.0 version of Challenger. Not as something different and potentially contradictory to its predecessor. Third well, it just makes sense. We debated this for a long time as a team and kept coming back to 1 inescapable conclusion. What's happening here is teaching, tailoring, and taking control. As you go through the book, we think you'll agree. Let's walk through each of these imperatives at a high level, just to Orient you to what's ahead. First, we're going to take a deep dive into teaching. Now commercial insight is a concept we first introduced in the Challenger sale and our work on consensus and mobilizers has reaffirmed for us the fact that truly counterintuitive commercial insight lies at the heart of the new World Challenger commercial model. Unfortunately, it's also the single thing we've seen companies struggle with the most when it comes to implementing Challenger, in part because they fail to appreciate that building insight is an organizational capability, not an individual salesperson skill, despite the many sales training vendors out there offering to train your salespeople on how to generate insights. And in part because they mistakenly assume that thought leadership is the same thing as counterintuitive insight, when in fact the two are quite different. What's more, our most recent work has convinced us that teaching can't be the job of just salespeople. Marketing must be involved not just in developing commercial insights, but in deploying them as well. Why? Because customers can now learn on their own. And while there's a pretty strong guarantee that your mobilizer will want to learn, there is no guarantee that they will want to learn from your sales reps. At least not initially. So seating the world with commercial insight is crucial to catch immobilizer, but only if we know where our mobilizers are most likely to learn. If they're not going to learn from sales, then marketing is going to have to find a way to get that content into the channels where they are going to learn. Second, once we cover teaching, we'll dig into the concept of tailoring to your mobilizer. Now tailoring, as we explained it in Challenger, is in fact still very important, but it is specifically important in that first movement to win over the mobilizer as an individual. Here we're talking about tailoring content depending on what type of mobilizer you believe you found. Remember there are three different types of mobilizer and each will attach to a commercial insight in a slightly different way. But that still doesn't explain what we saw in chapter one that better individual positioning can hurt you. In fact, it probably seems like we're saying that salespeople should do the very thing that we just told you in chapter one is bad. Well, what we've learned is that tailoring at the individual level is crucially important for winning an individual, but nonetheless dramatically insufficient for winning a high quality deal. At some point, you have to make a big shift from tailoring to win the individual to tailoring to win the group. Tailoring to win over the group requires a different kind of tailoring technique altogether. Later in Chapter 8, our section on taking control, we will talk about what has to happen to tailoring when we get into that second movement of the sale. When we have to go from winning the individual to winning the group. Because in this phase, we are not tailoring to win individual buy in, we are tailoring to win organizational consensus. The two kinds of tailoring are in fact different. If you do only the first kind of tailoring without the second kind of tailoring, you may win over the mobilizer but still end up with a low quality deal, or perhaps lose the deal altogether. Why? Because as good a job as we did connecting that individual to us, we failed to connect the mobilizer and the rest of the 4.4 to each other. Now how do you do that? Well, one thing we've learned is you're mobilizer may not fully know either. Just because they're willing to mobilize doesn't necessarily mean they'll be able to mobilize. Here is where we can help by essentially taking control of the consensus creation process ourselves and directing the group to agreement. The good news is there's a significant role both marketing and sales can play to tailor their content and their approach to help us take control of the consensus creation process to win a high quality deal. That matters deeply. After all, we don't get paid for individual buy in, we get paid for 5.4 agreement. That is the ticket out of these solutions. Graveyard. So let's turn now to taking control across that long distance. This is where we started our discussion in chapter one by focusing on what happens when suppliers try to bridge the second move in the sale from having one individual on board to building consensus across a group of individuals. Because of the diversity of these groups, which creates dysfunction among the 5.4 stakeholders trying to reach agreement, so many of our deals end up, despite doing everything right in the beginning in the solutions graveyard. Why does this happen? As you'll recall, it's because each stakeholder has his or her own mental model, and the overlap in mental models is likely to be minimal at best. Each person approaches the consensus moment with a different conception of what's important, what needs to be included in the proposal, and what victory looks like. Left to their own devices, they will push apart rather than pull together, something that tailoring only to the individual level will actually cause, or at the very least exacerbate, ultimately landing the group in a place where they can't decide on much of anything. What began for the supplier as a complex long term high margin solutions deal ends up as nothing more than the purchase of a simple low margin commoditized product. Because the group left to Bicker about what was really important in the proposal couldn't reach consensus on anything more. How do we overcome this? Here we'll go deep into the concept of collective learning, one of the biggest eye openers for us in the past five years that we've been studying the phenomenon of consensus. Collective learning is a technique for taking control of the consensus process. It's about the supplier helping to facilitate that consensus building process by offering a framework, a new collective mental model that anchors A diverse and dysfunctional buying group on a common vision, an aspiration they can all coalesce around rather than defaulting to lowest common denominator buying. As we mentioned before, this is less about connecting us to our mobilizer or even to individual stakeholders and much more about connecting the other 4.4 to each other. It's about shifting our sales and marketing approach, historically focused on gathering a collection of yeses, one from each individual stakeholder, in the hopes that they'll come together and hold hands on a decision. To gathering a collective, Yes, from the group. But as great an asset as they are in forging consensus, mobilizers need some help when it comes to buying our solutions. So we'll introduce a second concept here, all in the vein of taking control called commercial Coaching. This is really about coaching your mobilizer on how to buy versus the conventional wisdom of asking the customer to coach you on how to sell. Are you ready? Let's start our journey by unpacking the concept of teaching.\n",

      "Content: Chapter One. The dark side of customer consensus.  This is a book of surprises. Chief among them is the surprising decline of historically effective selling strategies that now fail to generate anything near hoped for returns. Despite suppliers improved ability to convey their unique value, there's strong evidence that today's customers are less willing than ever before to actually pay for that value even when they perceive it. At least not when they believe the next, best, less expensive alternative is good enough to meet their needs. While today's suppliers may win the battle for awareness, consideration, recommendation and even preference, they still lose when it comes to what matters most. Getting paid. As exasperating as it seems, the very solutions most companies develop to escape commoditization have themselves become commoditized in the eyes of their customers. It all leaves commercial leaders wondering, what do we do now? What's left when the classic sales and marketing playbook we've relied on for so many years falls short? It was partly in response to these questions that CEB Sales and Marketing Practice conducted the research that led to the publication of the Challenger sale. An in-depth examination of the sales Rep behavior is most likely to succeed in today's commercial environment. But while the debate raged around us as to whether Challenger was right or wrong, new or old, too controversial or not controversial enough, we were focused on something else entirely. What else is there? In fact, the more research we did, the more insights we uncovered, and the more convinced we became that there was a second part to this story. One potentially more powerful than the first. It turns out the far bigger story isn't about suppliers struggle to sell solutions, It's the customers struggle to buy them. While there are many reasons customers fail to buy, our data shows clearly that the primary culprit is the dramatic increase in both number and diversity of customer stakeholders typically involved in solutions purchases today and more damning, the severe dysfunction that is bred by the ever expanding number of individuals who need to weigh in before a deal is signed. In the end, what has long seemed to salespeople like a well designed strategy to stick it to suppliers or beat them up on price is more often than not a function of a far less sinister but arguably infinitely more intractable problem. The inability of customers, stakeholders themselves, to achieve broad agreement on a common course of action in the first place. Much of the commoditization pressure suppliers face today isn't the result of customers willingness to settle for good enough. It's their failure to agree on anything more. And that's a challenge most sales and marketing strategies fail to solve, as it's a problem they were never designed to address in the first place. In fact, current sales and marketing tactics exacerbate this problem rather than overcome it. Of course, it's hard enough to sell effectively. How exactly are we supposed to help our customers to buy more effectively? Here, the research holds a final, delightful surprise. Just as we learned in our previous work that it is critical to have Challenger sellers, our latest work shows that it is equally, if not more, critical to have Challenger buyers. In a series of quantitative studies, we were able to isolate and study these individuals. These aren't your run-of-the-mill coaches or advocates doling out information to the sales Rep and vocally championing a given supplier with colleagues. These are a special breed of customer stakeholder focused much more on marshalling the internal resources and buy in necessary to compel their colleagues to collectively think and act beyond the status quo irrespective of supplier. As we've studied these individuals in a great deal of depth, what we've found is in a world of diverse and potentially dysfunctional customer stakeholders, it's not just that you challenge, but who you challenge that really matters. To win today, you need a challenger inside the customer organization. These customer challengers exist and can be found, but only if suppliers are looking for them in the first place. Because everything we've learned in all of our research clearly suggests that finding these individuals, winning them over, and then equipping them to win takes a completely different kind of commercial strategy than what's worked so well in the past. Who are these customer challengers? We call them mobilizers, and this is their story.  The problem of one of three. If there is one concern most top of mind among senior sales and marketing leaders around the world, it is the inexorable downward pressure on deal size, margins and growth as they navigate continued uncertain times. While their CEO's mandate a return to double digit growth. Commercial leaders find themselves more frequently than ever before, competing on little else but price. Perhaps most frustrating, however, is that traditionally proven strategy is designed to drive that growth No longer work nearly as well as they used to, leaving senior executives to assume they've somehow lost their way, broadly calling for a return back to basics as they exhort their teams to. Recommit to more disciplined execution. However, getting ever better at an approach already proven to fail does little more than demoralize everyone in the face of ever deepening underperformance. As the head of sales and marketing at a global industrial fragrances company recently put it. I just don't understand. We're the leading supplier in our industry. Our products are world class, our brands second to none, and our salespeople are highly skilled. There's not a single deal in our industry where we're not invited to participate. We make it to the table every single time. But even when we do, he went on, we're always one of three suppliers at the table. Despite all of our commercial strength, we end up competing on nothing but price every single time. It's killing our business. Our premium position simply can't sustain that kind of margin erosion. It's an incredibly common, but still maddeningly frustrating scenario. Here's a company that excels across every commercial metric that might matter, but still faces deep commoditization nonetheless. Welcome to what we've come to call the one of three problem, where a supplier commonly wins the battle for customer consideration, even preference, but ends up competing against two others on little but price nevertheless. How to respond? Typically, heads of sales and marketing would tell you if customers fail to fully pay us for all the incremental value we provide, then clearly they must not appreciate all the incremental value we provide. So they direct their teams to sharpen the company's value proposition. They equip reps to more crisply articulate the many ways in which their company can not only meet customers needs, but exceed them. Be carefully redesigned marketing campaigns and sales collateral to better communicate the broad range of their companies best in class, cutting edge solutions and unique ability to provide moments of deep customer delight. And yet in today's world, even when delivered well, most customers reaction to suppliers costly efforts to better articulate their company's value isn't so much wow, we had no idea, but rather something closer akin to yeah, we knew that already. Today's customers will often concede the point right up front. Responding. We totally agree. We think you guys are great, Your solution is by far the best and we'd love to partner with you. Which feels fantastic until they add. In fact, that's why you're one of the three companies we've invited to participate in this bidding process. But as much as we love your solution, this other company solution is good enough and they're a lot cheaper. So if we can get your solution at their price, then we're good to go. And that's painful. Despite suppliers best efforts to better convey their unique value, there is little evidence that today's customers are any more willing to pay for that value even when they perceive it. At least not when they believe the next best alternative to be sufficiently good enough. So a supplier wins in every way possible, raising awareness, consideration, preference, even recommendations, and still loses when it comes to what matters most. Getting paid. This is the core dilemma of selling solutions. Today most suppliers single biggest competitor isn't so much the competition's ability to sell as their own customers willingness to settle. Across the last five years, the CEB team has dug into this challenge with a huge amount of research into both sales and marketing capability and customer buying behavior, seeking to understand what suppliers can do differently going forward to avoid the underperformance of past approaches. What we've learned is fascinating, if not more than a little bit troubling. Much of the problem lies less in a supplier organizations inability to sell effectively and far more in a customer organizations inability to buy effectively. And a very large part of that challenge lies squarely in customers struggle to achieve common agreement across the wide range of stakeholders now typically involved in virtually any solutions purchase. The rise and fall of the 5.4. One might argue that the challenge of customer consensus is nothing new. Indeed, we've been hearing of the problem for years. And of course the economic downturn in 2009 did nothing but exacerbate the problem as increasingly cost conscious and risk averse decision makers balked at making even the smallest decisions on their own. And yet, if we Fast forward to today, the strange thing is while the global economy has significantly rebounded across virtually every metric that might matter, in that same time, the customer consensus challenge has become far worse. In a recent survey of senior sales leaders, we found nearly 80% reported the number of customer stakeholders involved in a typical deal continues to rise. Why? There are all sorts of reasons for the added number of individuals involved in a deal today, but chief among them would be. 1A Sustained and widespread aversion to risk among both individual customer stakeholders and organizations in the aftermath of the global economic crisis. Two, the fact that most solutions today have both a technological component and a higher price tag, necessitating not only the involvement of IT, but additional scrutiny by operations and procurements executives. 3A Greater concern among legal and compliance officers that all corporate initiatives meet tighter regulatory requirements and information protection protocols. Four, governmental regulatory reform, especially in health care, forcing industry wide shifts in how customers operate and buy. Five customers Efforts to expand operations globally, bringing new regional players to the table. Six, the simple fact that most solutions offered by suppliers today are purposefully designed to integrate more customer functions and tasks than ever before in order to provide customers higher impact, better value and improved ease of use. Seven new management styles and organizational structures leading to flatter, more networked organizations that place a premium on more frequent cross silo collaboration. Every one of these trends not only means more people involved in a typical purchase than ever before, but more important, more people across more roles who likely haven't been involved in the past. Of course, none of these trends is likely to reverse itself anytime soon. Bottom line, it's nearly impossible today to get a deal done without accounting for a seemingly vast array of budget owners, influencers and users. Third party consultants, you name it. But as the consensus story continues to evolve, the thing we find most troubling isn't the rise in number of people who have to buy in, but the equally dramatic increase in number of people who have to sign off. So unlike the consensus challenge of 2006, which largely centered around winning over a single senior decision maker and his or her team, today's consensus challenge has evolved into something far more complex. Today, whether suppliers are selling to a customer with 50 or 50,000 people, they rarely find that almost mythical senior decision maker able to individually approve a complex deal on behalf of all of their colleagues. Instead, more often than not, it's purchased by committee. It's collective consensus across a formal or informal group of senior employees, each with the ability to stop a deal if it fails to meet their particular needs or speak to their individual priorities. And that problem, we find, stretches well beyond just larger customers or more strategic accounts. Consensus challenges are just as likely to crop up in small and medium customers, where suppliers have traditionally been able to conduct most business through a single point of contact. As one sales leader in the food and beverage industry jokingly observed, even when we sell to mom and pops, we've got a mom and a pop, and they don't always see eye to eye. Small business isn't exempt from the consensus challenge. In fact, let's put some real numbers against this problem. In a survey of over 3000 stakeholders involved in a typical B2B purchase, we found that customers themselves report an average of 5.4 different people formally involved in a typical purchase decision. That's 5.4 opportunities for someone to say no. And that one simple number raises all sorts of questions for suppliers. Things like, do we even know who those 5.4 people are? For that matter, does our customer even know who those 5.4 people are? Sometimes they're not sure either. What does each of these individuals care about? How does our solution meet their individual needs? How do we win them over? The real trick in this new world of customer consensus is this isn't just 5.4 different people, it's 5.4 different perspectives. 3/4 of customer stakeholders we surveyed told us these 5.4 individuals span a wide variety of roles, teams, functions and geographies. And really this is the true challenge of consensus today. It's not so much that there are more people in a sale that makes things so hard. But that there are so many new perspectives. Every supplier has a version of this exact same story. For example, if you sell an IT solution, almost certainly you've traditionally called on the customers CIO and his or her team. But as most IT solutions today touch other parts of the business or more business decisions than ever before now feature a strong technological component. Now you're just as likely to also sell to CMO's, CEO's, or heads of HR, depending on who's using your system. Additionally, the broader scope and bigger footprint of your solution probably means you're also speaking with the CFO to procurement and maybe to regional presidents. Not to mention a whole range of end users, influencers, third party consultants and even potential partners. And lest we forget Legal, AKA the Sales Prevention Department. Indeed, one head of marketing in the healthcare industry recently told us for us it's not 5.4 people, but 5.4 committees of people. Bottom line, every supplier has their version of the same story, regardless of industry. We used to sell to X and now we sell to XYZ. As well as A, B and sometimes C. And everyone of them is different. Different priorities, different perspectives, different authority, even different levels of knowledge of what the supplier solution actually does in the first place and why that matters. That's the real challenge of customer consensus today. It isn't just a quantity problem. It's a diversity problem. Because when these groups come together to make a decision, almost inevitably it seems, things fall apart. The purchase likelihood drops dramatically as soon as a second decision maker is present. In a survey of 3000 customer stakeholders involved in a B2B purchase, we asked respondents the degree to which they agreed with the statement. We will definitely buy from this supplier in the next six months on a scale from 1:00 to 10:00. We tested other time horizons and got virtually the exact same result. Six months allowed us to capture the largest sample. We then map those responses according to total number of people on the buying team. Our data tells a dramatic story featuring two distinct downward inflection points. The first represents a rapid drop in purchase likelihood just by adding one more person to the purchase decision. So going from one to two people means overall likelihood to buy goes off a Cliff, dropping from 80% to the mid 50s. Indeed, apparently Mom and Pop don't always agree. Then things level off for a bit until we get past person #5. Then there's a second Cliff where likelihood to buy sinks like a stone to a dismal 30%. As a supplier selling to the 5.4, this is a hard graph to look at. From left to right, this is a one way ticket to indecision, with a final stop somewhere squarely in the center of what some sales leaders have come to call the solutions graveyard. From a research perspective, this finding proved hugely important, as it gave us the first indication in all our data that suppliers don't have nearly so much of A selling problem as perhaps they do a buying problem. Brought on largely by the new and wildly diverse cast of characters typically involved today in any Solutions purchase. For suppliers, however, that's a tough finding to digest as it's hard to know how to manage this kind of challenge. After all, customer diversity isn't something suppliers can make go away by telling their customer. Actually, we don't think your legal or procurement teams need to look this one over. For even if that attempt were to succeed in the short run, the long term consequences can be costly. As the chief sales officer at a global manufacturing company recently told us, we actually tried exactly that just last year, and it worked. We successfully cut everyone out of the purchase other than the head of operations and got the deal done in record time. The problem, he went on, was that when we then went to implement what we'd sold, all those people we'd previously caught out realized what was happening and completely overwhelmed the installation with objections and conflicts that we could have handled in advance if we just included them to begin with. In the end, he said, as hard as it may have been, we would have been far better off getting all those individuals on board as part of the purchase process because the bad will we generated as part of a rocky implementation not only undermine this deal, but likely cut us out of future deals for the foreseeable future. It's an incredibly tough thing to find out after it's too late to do anything about it. But it raises the questions If suppliers can't fully or even partially eliminate customer diversity as part of a sale, then how can they at least manage it more effectively? What's the best strategy for selling to increasingly diverse customer buying groups? Track them all down and win them all over. Around the world, the strategy for selling to diverse stakeholders follows the same frustrating reality. It requires a whole lot of work, and it requires a whole lot of time. In fact, most sales professionals agree the battle for customer consensus plays out across 2 dimensions, not just one. The first dimension is a challenge of access, simply winning the right to get in front of all the individuals who matter in the first place. And that's hard. With all those new people involved, the first step is figuring out who they all are in the first place. We encourage sellers to begin with the question, who are our 5.4 for this particular deal? It's a disarmingly simple question, but often surprisingly difficult to answer. In many cases, these aren't just new individuals, but new roles, functions, and maybe even geographies that that supplier has traditionally never called on before. And chances are pretty good that customers, stakeholders exact role in the purchase may be somewhat murky even to themselves. Beyond identifying them, however, is the more difficult task of winning. The right to speak with them, particularly as a seller may have little to no prior experience or existing connections to fall back on even in existing accounts with otherwise long standing relationships. What's worse, from the perspective of that target stakeholder, they may see no especially pressing need to talk to that supplier at all if they fail to see a relationship between their immediate concerns and the suppliers capabilities. Beyond winning access to each of these individuals, however, sellers still face the even greater challenge of winning each of them over ensuring they position their offering as precisely as possible so as to resonate with each stakeholders priorities and needs. And they have to do that 5.4 times, tracking them all down and then winning them all over. Now, one might argue, there's nothing new here. After all, that's nothing more than just plain good selling, same as it's been for years. But the real challenge is this is no longer a single sale, but a serial sale, each one a little different and carefully positioned to each stakeholder. To be sure, it is great selling, but it's great selling times 5.4. Checking off each stakeholder as they go, ensuring they've bought in before they move on to the next one. This one challenge has become the heart and soul of most sales managers checking calls with their team. So who have you called on so far? How did it go? Are they on board? How do you know? OK, who's next? How are you going to get in front of them? How are you going to position things for them? How do you think they'll react? What objections do you think they might have? Insert role play? OK, who's left after that? So reps work from the known to the less known, the familiar to the less familiar, slowly building consensus step by step as they seek to collect a yes from each of those conversations. A tenured sales manager we interviewed memorably compared it to the plate spinning act at the circus. You get the first plate spinning on the stick and then move on to the second. You get the second one spinning and move to the third, but somewhere along the line the first plate has started to wobble, so you have to go back and get it under control as you're simultaneously trying to move on to the 4th. And so it goes across the board, winning one stakeholder at a time. Check, check and check. But the deeper into the 5.4 we go, the harder these conversations become. In an all too common but still deeply painful scenario, the head of sales at a company that sells highly technical instruments for the manufacturing sector told us that his sales reps are almost exclusively trained engineers, which has always made sense in the past as they've traditionally called on engineers inside the customer organization. However, across the last five years, as the scope, impact and expense of their newer solutions have expanded, they can now rarely get a deal done without also speaking with the customer's head of finance. The problem is their reps have never sold to CFO's before and find them completely intimidating, so they avoid calling them altogether. But what do you do when your own Salesforce is literally too scared to call your customer? At first glance it might sound somewhat absurd, but this happens all over the world every single day. This is what happens when sellers move into the world of the 5.4. Sales reps familiar comfort zone of selling doesn't expand nearly as fast as customers required. Consensus zone for buying. Likewise, parallel efforts in marketing don't fare much better. A recent move in B2B marketing towards something known as B2P or business to people marketing arises in part from this exact same trend. There, the thinking goes, even in the world of business to business buying, it's not companies that buy things, but people that do. And with the rapid increase in both number and diversity of people involved in a typical purchase, suppliers have to understand those people today far better and get in front of them far earlier than ever before, with content and campaigns that will more specifically speak to each of their unique needs and priorities. In many ways, it's the marketing analog to the track them all down and win them all over sales strategy. So not surprisingly then, we've observed a strong and renewed interest among more advanced marketing teams in building ever more accurate customer personas, trying to understand individual buyers and their needs. Simultaneously, we've watched marketing organizations dedicate increasing amounts of time and money to building more targeted content designed to speak to very specific members of the 5.4 about the issues they care about most at each stage of the purchase journey. Given the scope of the challenge, however, these same teams, often made-up of only a handful of people, become easily overwhelmed trying to place highly personalized original content in all the right places at all the right times for all the right people involved in a typical purchase process. Even then, there is often little concrete evidence to show that any of this effort translates into real commercial outcomes, leaving marketers to point to intermediate measures like increased click through rates or more likes on the company Facebook page to justify the added time and expense of their effort. When we put it together, it's no wonder that commercial leaders around the world complain of increased cost of sale, longer cycle times, stall deals and smaller deal sizes. The ongoing battle of tracking down each of the 5.4 and then successfully winning each of them over not only takes a huge amount of time and effort, it's fraught with challenge every step of the way. And it leaves commercial leaders around the world thinking the same thing. As one head of sales and marketing put it to us rather poignantly, there's got to be a better way. All this customer consensus is killing our business. But what could that better answer be? In search of answers. Given this strong pressure on performance, the CEB sales and marketing practice recently set out to study the dynamics of customer consensus in far greater depth than we ever had in the past. At the center of this work was an effort to supplement the vast amount of customer research we'd already conducted in the past with new data aimed at group buying dynamics. And much of that data came from a survey of 1000 people all involved in some fashion in a typical B to B purchase, representing a wide range of both industries and geographies. More than anything else, the survey was designed to shed new light on the complex relationship across group buying behaviors, commercial outcomes, purchase attributes and sales Rep behavior. The story that arose from all that work is fascinating as upon first glance, it is deeply counterintuitive. In fact, when we first ran our analysis, we weren't sure whether we should believe the result. We went back and reran the numbers, remodeled the data, rechecked the sample in an effort to undo a finding that we initially found very difficult to believe. But the findings proved incredibly robust. Though those findings didn't seem to make a lot of sense when we first saw them, as we dug deeper into the data and continued to dissect the challenge it was meant to address, we came to the conclusion that we've been thinking about the consensus problem in exactly the wrong way, the implications for sales and marketing. We're huge. An unexpected finding? To show you what we mean, let's start with a concept we'll call a high quality sale, which serves as the backbone for much of our consensus work. The idea here is suppliers aren't looking to close just any business, they're looking to close good business. So while it is true that suppliers lose to status quo far more often than they'd like, it is equally true that even when they win, they often don't win the way they'd hoped. Perhaps the customer bought a much smaller, good enough version of their solution. Or maybe the customers so completely beat them up on price that the deal came in way below target margins? So technically we might call those deals wins, but they're hollow victories at best. We hear this all the time from commercial leaders. It's not so much the low quantity of deals they're doing that causes the real pain, but the low quality of the deals that are ultimately sold. So when we talk about a high quality sale in our data, what we're trying to capture is the kind of deal where customers buy the bigger solution at a higher margin. In our study, we defined a quality sale as a deal where customers number one did not settle for a less ambitious solution, but number two purchased a premium offering relative to the base offering. We tested for those attributes through a number of different questions across our various survey instruments. So now the question becomes, how does suppliers win that kind of high quality deal, especially in a 5.4 world? Well, let's go back to our strategy for selling to diversity in the first place and see what happens. You'll remember the conventional sales and marketing approach in the 5.4 world is we have to track them all down and then win them all over. When we ran the various commercial activities associated with that approach through our model, we found something rather shocking. When we measured each of those two approaches, IE winning access or tracking them all down and then better individual positioning or winning them all over against the probability of winning a high quality sale, we found that winning access to key stakeholders boosts that probability by a positive 4%. But positioning our offering to resonate more strongly with each stakeholder actually reduces that probability by 4%. Now, what do those numbers mean? Let's take them one at a time. The way to interpret the access number, for example is this. If we were to move from below average performance to above average performance on winning access to each stakeholder across the 5.4, we'd be 4% more likely to close a high quality deal. In other words, access matters. It has a statistically significant impact on driving up deal quality. Though you'd likely agree, it doesn't appear to matter nearly as much as anyone might have thought. After all, a 4% increase doesn't seem to be all that meaningful. That's kind of strange. But even stranger is our finding for Tactic #2. This is about winning over each stakeholder one at a time by connecting our offer as strongly as possible to whatever they care about the most. So we position our offer to meet their needs, emphasizing our ability to address their specific priorities, speak to their individual view of what's important, and connect directly to what they've got to get done, IE their MB, O's, personal projects, etc. And the impact here is actually negative. Now what does that mean? Well, what it means is that the better we get at customizing our offer at the individual level, the less likely we are to close a high quality deal. Effectively personalizing our offer to each stakeholder decreases deal quality, pushing us deeper into the very commodity trap we were hoping to avoid by personalizing in the first place. In fact, when we dig into the data one level deeper, we find that if we move from below average performance to above average performance on personalization, we're 20% more likely to have a negative impact on overall deal quality. In other words, the better one positions the offer to the individual, the more likely there is to be a negative impact on overall deal quality. It doesn't seem to make any sense. We can tell you our first reaction to these results was a whole lot of surprise mixed with more than just a little bit of concern. After all, we're the challenger guys, the group who found that the best reps are defined by their ability to teach, tailor, and take control. And yet this data seems to indicate that tailoring can actually hurt you. So we stared at this for a really long time, trying to figure out what was going on. But it wasn't until we saw the rest of the story, which we'll turn to next, that we figured out what's going on here. And when you see it, you'll find that this result makes a lot of sense. In fact, you'll likely be as surprised as we were that it wasn't more obvious all along. But before we go there, we first offer one crucial note to provide some important context to our earlier work. Rest assured, today is not the day we disavow ourselves of the Challenger findings and apologetically declare that we got it wrong the first time around. As you'll see, as we continue to work through all of our findings in the world of the 5.4, a challenger approach replete with effective tailoring is arguably more important than ever before. That said, at the same time, these findings have also led us to realize that we must be far more precise about what we mean by tailoring and how we go about it, in order not to inadvertently do damage where we sought to do good. For, the data is indeed very clear. Tailoring done the wrong way can have a significantly chilling effect on overall deal quality. Our traditional sales approach of gaining access and then making our pitch 5.4 times is insufficient to drive commercial growth. Yet that's exactly what most sales and marketing organizations are doing right now, all with the very best of intentions of pursuing a commercial strategy that, frankly, at first blush, seems inescapably logical. So what exactly is going on here? Well, remember, all of this research was conducted within a very specific context, not of selling behavior, but of buying behavior. Even more specifically, group buying behavior. Because what we're ultimately trying to figure out isn't how suppliers can sell effectively to individuals, but rather how they can sell more effectively to groups of individuals. And even more important, diverse groups of individuals. What we found is more than anything else, it's the diversity of these groups that makes all the difference. If there is one finding in all of our consensus work that stands above all others, it is that selling to individuals and selling to groups of diverse individuals is not the same thing. But not because the selling is different. Rather, because the buying is different. Solving for the right problem. You'll remember, the core tenet of marketers push toward B2P marketing, including more personalized content and messaging, is the broad recognition that at the end of the day, it's not companies that buy things, but people that do. And if we don't understand and connect to those people better than ever before, we'll fail to win them over. However, based on all of our research, what we've come to conclude is this. While it may be true that even in business settings it's not companies that buy things, but people that do, in today's B to B environment, it is equally true that it's not people that buy things, but groups of them that do. If we don't understand how these groups of people work together, if we sell only at the individual level and not simultaneously at the collective level, there's a good chance we'll miss what has become the most important dynamic in B to B selling today. Finding a way to connect the diverse individuals that comprise a buying group around a higher level vision than where they're most likely to land on their own. Why is that? There's a very good reason and it shows up right in the data. If we map the relationship between stakeholder diversity and something we've come to call stakeholder dysfunction, we find the relationship between the two to be very telling. Let's start with a couple of definitions. First, stakeholder diversity is based on the range of different functions, roles, teams, geographies, and divergent priorities represented across the various stakeholders directly involved in the purchase decision. Stakeholder dysfunction, on the other hand. Captures the degree to which members of that buying group struggle to effectively collaborate across a number of important dimensions. More specifically, for the purposes of this work, stakeholder dysfunction goes up when one's various stakeholders don't have a fair say in Group discussion. Two stakeholders avoid discussions of the most important issues regarding a purchase altogether. Three stakeholders outright disagree with one another multiple times regarding purchase details. These are all things that can be measured quantitatively by asking survey respondents a series of questions regarding how they collaborated with other members of the buying group. And really, this is pretty familiar stuff. If you think about a group purchase you've been involved in recently, you'll undoubtedly see some of your own experience in at least one or two of those attributes. Think for example about the most recent purchase of a new CRM solution in your organization and how that played out. So let's look at the relationship between these two things, diversity and dysfunction. The data is very clear. As stakeholder diversity increases, so does dysfunction. Pretty dramatically, in fact. Or put another way, as the diversity of the various stakeholders that suppliers find themselves selling to continues to expand, they can expect to see an equally dramatic rise in the dysfunction of the groups comprised of those increasingly diverse individuals. This all makes a ton of sense. There are all sorts of reasons why more diverse groups struggle to function effectively. If someone is working with a group of colleagues across their company, all representing different, sometimes even competing, perspectives and priorities, it's almost inevitable that they're going to disagree with at least someone. Not personally, but almost certainly professionally, as everyone is working toward whatever priorities make the most sense for their part of the business. In that environment, there are all sorts of reasons why individuals might fail to connect as that group deliberates. We all have a tendency to think very carefully about the cost benefit, trade-offs of different kinds and levels of group engagement. I don't want to share my opinion or advocate too strongly for my position. It's too hard. They won't get it. It's a lot of work for very little benefit. It's just not worth it. Or perhaps. I won't speak up because I don't wanna look dumb or selfish or too dominant or too weak or sound too much like I'm not a team player. On the other hand, other individuals might push too hard, seeking to win over the group by sheer force of will or rhetoric or even volume, failing to understand the very different perspectives around them. Achieving group consensus in an environment like that can be extremely difficult. Overtime everyone loses patience and maybe even gives up. Actually, when we think of it that way, it's a wonder that groups can agree on anything at all. That said, things don't necessarily have to be this way. When it comes to effectively creating customer consensus, the data provides a ray of hope as well. For just because diversity and dysfunction are highly correlated doesn't mean that they have to always be intertwined. In the end, suppliers may not have an uncontrollable diversity problem so much as they have an addressable dysfunction problem. Unlike customer diversity, which is largely out of suppliers control, customer dysfunction is something they can do something about, but probably not very well given conventional sales and marketing strategy. Because imagine how the track them all down and win them all over approach plays out in this world of high customer dysfunction. It does nothing to solve for the problem because this is a problem it was never designed to solve. Current sales and marketing tactics are designed to do something completely different. They are far more focused on better connecting individual customers, stakeholders to the supplier than they are on better connecting those same individual customer stakeholders to each other. To shed light on just how poorly suppliers Old World Commercial Approach is designed to solve for customers New World Buying dysfunction, let's take a closer look at what these buying groups are struggling to agree on in the first place. Because, as it turns out, the most common source of customer dysfunction has nothing to do with the supplier in the first place. Climbing the ME to We mountain. If we think about the various stages customer stakeholders must pass through to move a purchase forward at a high level we can narrow it down to three in particular, each crucially important. One problem definition. Two solution identification. 3 supplier selection. At any one of those points, things can go off the rails pretty badly as relevant customer stakeholders potentially fail to reach agreement. So as a hypothetical example, let's say a company has recognized they're unable to make effective strategic decisions due to their lack of quality data-driven insight. So what to do? Well, first that team has to reach agreement on what exactly the underlying problem is in the first place. Is a data quality data quantity. Data gathering. Analysis capabilities. Or maybe they have all the data they need, but it's trapped in various legacy systems that don't effectively communicate with one another. Whatever the case, that buying group has to first define the problem it's trying to solve. That said, once they've reached agreement on the problem, there's still the question of what to do about it. So let's say for example, they've settled on a data analysis problem. Now how to solve for better data analysis? Well, there are all sorts of approaches one might take there, ranging from something relatively straightforward like buying better analytical software, to giving staff the tools they need to study and play with the data in new ways, all the way to investing in training and development to give them the skills they need. To perform more sophisticated analysis. Of course, across that very broad spectrum of possible solutions, there are myriad other options, ranging from less expensive and disruptive to extremely so. Without agreement on a course of action, however, that deal isn't going anywhere. So for the sake of argument, let's say that that team has identified a solution that they can all agree on. Maybe it's the purchase of a new suite of analytical tools. The next step would be to shop that solution with various vendors in order to determine which one can best meet their needs and then eventually select the one that everyone can agree on. Now, admittedly, any given solutions purchase is far more complicated and far less linear than this. But it's an instructive abstraction nonetheless, as it allows us to measure the relative difficulty of each of these decision nodes across a typical purchase process. What we wanted to figure out in this analysis, in the unforgettable words of a senior manager at a business services company, was At what point across that continuum does the wailing and mashing of teeth reach a crescendo inside the customer company, exposing that deal to the greatest amount of potentially insurmountable customer dysfunction? Or put in a far less colorful way, when that purchase is most likely to fail. Now to figure that out, we asked respondents, as part of a much larger survey of 3000 customer stakeholders involved in a B2B purchase, to rate each of these three critical moments in terms of their relative difficulty, both with respect to reaching an individual or me decision. And in terms of achieving collective agreement or a wee decision? The first thing we find in our analysis is a much better understanding of just how much harder group decisions are than individual ones. Across the board, at each of those three decision points, the group decision, the wee moment proved dramatically harder than the individual decision, the Me moment. In fact, we can quantify the difference. On average, group decisions are nearly twice as hard as individual ones. If you think about any major purchase you've been a part of in your own organization, we'd imagine this finding will ring true. This is the price we pay for diverse buying groups. That said, the far more interesting output of this analysis is a clear indication that not all we moments are created equal. One in particular stands out as especially difficult, and that's solution identification. So while customers, stakeholders might all agree they have a problem, the data and common experience tells us there's likely going to be some pretty significant debate on the best way to solve that problem. This is a hugely valuable thing for us to know. Because it tells us that if suppliers are going to focus time and effort on creating customer consensus, the place where they really need to rally agreement is around the specific solution to the customers problem, irrespective of supplier. Now, by the same token, the analysis also tells us the thing least likely to create disagreement among stakeholders is supplier selection. Why is that? Largely because by the time the group has coalesced around a well defined high priority problem and an agreed upon clear course of action in many cases. From that point forward the biggest question left to address is simply which of any number of possible suppliers can deliver a well aligned solution. At a relatively reasonable price. Welcome back to the 103 problem. But if that's the case, then this data also tells us something about what most sellers and marketers are likely doing right now to win customer consensus, if they're doing anything at all. Because traditionally speaking, if there's one thing all suppliers are trying to get their customer stakeholders to agree on, it's that their company is great. That they're the best, that they're the leading provider of whatever solution that customer is already looking for. In most cases, that message sounds something like this. Our company is a leading customer focused global provider of innovative solutions supported by cutting edge innovations designed to empower organizations with different in kind sources of broad based value creation at their most critical moments of need. And oh, by the way, we're green. Sound familiar? If there was one thing we'd all want customers to agree on, surely that would be it. That we're the market leader, the leading brand, the best possible partner that we can not only meet their needs, but exceed them. So that's the thing all suppliers focus on. But what this data tells us is if that's the focus of suppliers consensus building efforts, then they're solving for only one of three possible consensus failure points across a purchase path. And of those three, they're almost exclusively focused on the least difficult for customers to agree upon. Not the most. At the same time, those same suppliers are leaving customers on their own to achieve agreement around the two points where things tend to fall apart. So if a purchase decision is going to stall, more likely than not, it's going to stall far earlier than most suppliers would anticipate. Particularly if they're focused only on watching for signs of customer disagreement around the value of their offering. As much as leaders tell us they want their reps to get in earlier, this data tells us pretty emphatically that if they do indeed manage to get in earlier, they need to take that opportunity to help customers overcome the challenge they're facing earlier. And that challenge has little to do with choosing A supplier and everything to do with deciding which problems are worth solving in the first place and what solutions are worth pursuing to solve them all, irrespective of supplier. This is why the Challenger approach proves so effective, as that's exactly what it's designed to do. To give you a sense of just how painful this kind of misalignment can be, the CMO at a medical equipment company told us the following story when he saw this data. Historically, his company has sold to surgeons who would debate the merits of their product versus those of the competition. It was a straight up battle over who had the superior capability. But today, when they call on those same hospitals, they find they're no longer sitting at the table with just the surgeon, but with a diverse group of buyers comprised of the chief surgeon, the CFO, the head of procurement and various hospital administrators. So now, instead of debating which suppliers medical equipment to buy, this incredibly diverse buying group is deliberating whether they should buy any more medical equipment at all, or take that money and build a new parking garage as an additional revenue stream for the hospital. This is what happens when diverse groups get together. Dysfunction almost naturally follows as not only perspectives but priorities become highly divergent. But more likely than not, it's not even dysfunction or disagreement around which supplier to select, but rather around which problem to address in the first place and how to address it. It's a painful story, but indicative of how misaligned most suppliers are today in helping customers overcome arguably the number one obstacle in buying their solution. Counterintuitively, suppliers biggest challenge in winning customer consensus has nothing to do with that suppliers solution at all. Even more troubling, much of the customer's primary consensus challenge occurs far before most sellers are even present to address it in the first place. Mind the gap from 37 to 57. In a well documented study, see The End of Solution Sales, Harvard Business Review, July to August 2012. The CEB team asked customer stakeholders to consider a typical B to be purchase process from beginning to end and then identify the point at which their organization typically reaches out to a supplier to seek their advice. That answer came back as 57%. On average, customers are 57% of the way through a typical purchase process prior to proactively reaching out to a supplier sales Rep for their direct input on whatever it is that they're doing. For suppliers evolving to complex solutions, our data also tells us that the more complex the deal, the later the customer contact. Why? Likely because customers looking to make large investments in a complex solution want to be extra sure they've done sufficient due diligence to avoid being unduly swayed by a particularly charismatic sales Rep accompanied by an especially knowledgeable sales technician bent on pedaling a general supplier solution. Rather than addressing a specific customer need. Now that 57% number has huge implications for suppliers. If we consider what's likely happening inside that 57%, chances are pretty good that customers are now doing on their own most of the things that suppliers were hoping to do with them together. They're identifying a need. They're prioritizing that need relative to others. They're determining which capabilities they'll require to address that need. They're identifying which suppliers are best able to deliver that capability. In most cases, they're conducting preliminary research on how much each of those suppliers cost. So by the time a supplier is called in at that 57% mark, more often than not there's little left to discuss but price. As one senior leader memorably put it. That 57% is a freight train to RFP station. And we're on it. Still more troubling, however, is what happens when we place that 57% number into the context of customer consensus. Because in follow-up research, we also ask customers to identify the point in a purchase process at which internal conflict most likely reaches a peak. Or the wailing and mashing of teeth hits a crescendo, and that deal is in the greatest danger of falling apart altogether. And that number came back as 37%. Group conflict peaks at 37%. That's the summit of the Me to We Mountain, where that deal is most likely to die. And you'll remember that peak centers around solution identification, not supplier selection. A problem most suppliers infrequently address. But let's consider what happens when we put these two numbers together. If a purchase decision is most likely to stall at 37%, but a supplier sales Rep isn't likely to be called in until 57%, then the resulting gap between the two raises a very practical and pretty troubling question. How many times have suppliers lost a deal that they never even knew was in play to begin with as the customer couldn't make it past the 37% mark on their own? Or more simply, how many times have sellers lost before they could ever attempt to win? The answer, of course, is unknowable, though deeply disquieting nonetheless. For in that gap, from 37% to 57% is a trail littered with deals that have been left to die. Among the dried up markers, leftover takeout food and haphazard piles of double sided PowerPoints strewn across the floor of customer conference rooms around the world. All bearing witness to the five point fours inability to reach collective agreement. That gap has hugely important implications for suppliers. Traditionally, most commercial organizations have considered customer consensus to be primarily a sales challenge, requiring reps to win broad customer agreement on the ground, one person at a time. But if suppliers are largely relying upon sales to stitch together collective consensus once they're called in, then the data tells us they're missing a crucial part of the problem. Customer consensus isn't a sales challenge, it is a commercial challenge. To be sure, there are a number of things sales reps can and must do to crack open the 57% and win earlier access to customer deliberations. But in many cases, if suppliers are doing nothing to simultaneously address the consensus problem earlier through marketing, then there's a good chance that that deal can die before sales ever wins Sufficient access to get a chance to even try. This challenge must be attacked from both directions simultaneously. For marketing, part, far beyond battling for individual residents through more personalized campaigns and content be to be marketers are going to have to find ways to anticipate customer disconnects far earlier in the purchase process and avert them proactively. For left unaddressed, these disconnects can be devastating to the suppliers bottom line. Fighting the lowest common denominator. When we put it all together, we find the far bigger challenge for suppliers isn't improving their own abilities to sell. It's addressing the customers inability to agree. To understand what's going on here, let's introduce a concept called a mental model. Now, we'll examine mental models in a significant amount of depth later. But for now, to keep things simple, think of a mental model simply as the way an individual understands their world and how it works. We represent these mental models with three overlapping circles in the form of a Venn diagram. So these might be three different individuals in different roles, functions or geographies. For each mental model, each stakeholder will have their own goals, priorities, means, and metrics, all unique to their particular perspective. This is the source of dysfunction. It's not these stakeholders different backgrounds per se, but the fact that those different backgrounds bring with them different, even divergent, mental models. Of course, if a supplier must target 5.4 stakeholders, that potential divergence becomes that much worse. It's a very simple concept, but that's on purpose because a simple concept like this allows us to visualize very clearly just what suppliers are up against in creating broad based customer consensus around a high quality deal. That's because the question we can now ask when looking at a diagram like this is. Just how much overlap is there across the different mental models of the various stakeholders that we have to connect? Really, that's the question that matters most, because that overlap is the single point of agreement across all those stakeholders mental models. It's where they connect. Where they agree. And if that overlap is very small, then that group can agree on only very little. So, left to their own devices, various stakeholders come together to consider a purchase. And if they find few shared priorities or little common ground for mutual understanding, they settle on the lowest common denominator where they're most likely to agree. Things like avoid risk, move cautiously, reduce disruption and save money. Every supplier knows all too well what it feels like to be on the receiving end of that kind of customer consensus. This is dysfunction. And this is what it gets us. It's not that diverse customer buying groups can't agree on anything. It's just that left to their own devices, they can't agree on very much and will rarely agree on anything that is highly disruptive or ambitious. If we think about what all of this means for suppliers, what this tells us is as they move into a world of increasing stakeholder diversity, suppliers are simultaneously moving into a world of increasing stakeholder dysfunction brought on by decreasing overlap in their mental models. As the little overlapping triangle at the center of that Venn diagram continues to shrink, it's no wonder that suppliers are all competing with status quo small deals and low margins. That's the one thing left in common among an otherwise divergent and dysfunctional group of diverse decision makers. This is the commodity trap suppliers struggle to escape every single day that sits at the core of the one of three problem. And otherwise dysfunctional group of customer stakeholders, unable to agree on a common vision but forced to agree on something, is likely to agree on doing nothing. Or at least doing as little as possible in order to find common ground. We can see this phenomenon in the data as well. A Dysfunctional group is a full 50% less likely to pay a premium for a high cost offering than a functional group. If we think back to where we started with suppliers, common approach for creating customer consensus and play it out in this world, we're now in a much better position to understand the findings we saw earlier. As we consider the Track them Down and Win Them Over approach, you'll remember we found that while winning Greater Stakeholder Access may help. More careful positioning of one's offering to each stakeholders needs actually hurts us, at least in terms of driving high quality deals. And that finding was really counterintuitive. But now, using a Venn diagram like the one we described, we can see exactly why that's the case. If we think about aligning our supplier value proposition more closely to each stakeholders mental model, insofar as those models are divergent to begin with, then they're making things worse, not better. They're exacerbating the very separation that keeps this group from agreeing on anything but the most basic common ground in the first place. At the end of the day, suppliers, traditional sales and marketing efforts have likely emphasized difference rather than overcome it. Underscoring individual separation rather than reinforcing mutual connection. What's fascinating about all this is that these findings shed light on one of the most frustrating phenomena in complex sales today. Watching a deal wither on the vine, despite the fact that a supplier has managed to successfully secure the support of each and every stakeholder who seems to matter most. We see it all the time. All the time. Marketing's personalized content brings in a lead the first person out of the 5.4. The sales team picks it up and engages that first person who expressed interest. And then proceeds to track down each and every member of the 5.4 until they have successfully won them all over. One by one. Everything seems to be in place. Then somehow, at the last minute, after every stakeholder has said yes. The deal inexplicably falls apart. Or at the very least, it shrunk down to a much smaller size at a far lower price than what was originally proposed. The seller is left wondering what in the world just happened. We had it in the palm of our hand and then it all just sort of slipped away. As one sales leader put it more often than I care to admit, we live in a world where each person says yes, but then the group ultimately says no. It's like I live in a world where 1 + 1 + 1. Equals 0. How is that even possible? Well, using the mental model construct, we can now understand exactly how that might be possible. There are a number of different versions of the same story, but one reason that deal may still fall apart is the fact that in winning over each stakeholder, the seller specifically highlighted those components or parts of their offering that spoke most directly to each individual's needs. And why wouldn't they? After all, they were likely trained to do exactly that. But think about how that approach plays out across a dysfunctional group. If the seller personalizes the offering so much, then when each of the 5.4 comes together to compare notes, they find that the proposed deal is far bigger, far more disruptive, and far more expensive than anything anyone individual thought they were signing up for. And then that group will naturally scope it back down to an acceptable size. If the supplier has done nothing to overcome their divergent mental models, helping them better appreciate the important connections across their otherwise disparate decision making criteria, then that deal is almost certainly destined for the dustbin, or at least some significant downsizing to something mutually agreeable to everyone. Bottom line, if suppliers don't create convergence, their customers will. If it turns out that the only thing those customers can agree on is to do nothing, then at the end of the day that's exactly what they're going to do. But notice that supplier lost not because they failed to connect individual stakeholders to them, but rather because they overlooked the fact that those same stakeholders weren't necessarily very well connected to each other. And that's how 1 + 1 + 1 = 0. The supplier collects a yes from each individual, but still gets a collective know from the customer. Because it turns out there's a vast difference between a collection of Yeses and a collective yes. So can suppliers get to a collective? Yes. Absolutely. That's what this book is all about. But building that bridge from me to we will take a very specific strategy targeted to a very special stakeholder. From Me to we. To show you what we mean, let's think of a typical customer purchase process as moving through three distinct phases. In phase one, we begin with the customer in a state of status quo. Then, through the recognition of some particular need, or perhaps through the exposure to an insight provided by a supplier, at least one or two of the stakeholders in that customer organization come to realize that change is necessary. Indeed it is in this first movement from phase one to phase two where demand is born as this is where high performing sales reps who we've dubbed challengers approach the customer armed with powerful insight to challenge the way they think about their Business Research that we've documented extensively in. The Challenger sale. Specifically, in this first movement, tailoring one's content and approach is crucial to win these individuals over in the first place. For done well, these stakeholders land in phase two, which is individual willingness to explore alternate course of action. The idea here is that someone inside the customer organization has recognized that they have a clear need worth addressing and they have committed to exploring it further. Of course, the degree to which the supplier has skewed that vision in their favor is critical. This is where we left things at the conclusion of the Challenger sale in phase two, with a number of customer stakeholders excited about a new idea and what it could mean for their company. However, despite the hard won individual buy in a supplier may have achieved in phase two, that potential purchase is still a long way off from an actual closed deal as that insight now has to traverse along second journey from phase two to phase three, which may or may not land in Group agreement around an actual purchase decision. It is across this second movement where individual support must somehow evolve into group consensus, moving from me to we as the supplier works with that stakeholder to build a bridge to the other 4.4. This can be a tough road to hoe because it is here that the supplier has to bring in the other stakeholders, get them to meet, convince them to agree and win them over. Procurements. Gotta get involved. Finance has to approve. Legal has to look things over. This is why the distance from phase two to three is so much longer than the distance from one to two. One member joked. This is where good deals go to die. It is indeed the Solutions graveyard. But it is also here where the sellers tailoring strategy must morph into something else entirely, tailoring for group consensus rather than tailoring for individual buy in. For if we think about the best way to build that bridge from me to we landing in a collective, yes, at some point in this process, the supplier will have to transition pretty sharply from connecting individual stakeholders to them and start connecting those same stakeholders to each other. Yet many of these deliberations and conversations are most likely to happen behind closed doors and over the horizon, well beyond the direct influence of an individual seller. So influencing these conversations can be incredibly difficult. Harder still, there's no indication in any of our research that individual stakeholders are created equal in their ability to influence those discussions when the seller can't be there to do it directly. Despite their common support for a particular course of action, in other words, not all customer stakeholders are equally able or even willing to fight the good fight of winning over the other 4.4 at the same time. Quite the contrary, in fact. This is where star sellers make a critical choice for, it turns out, the specific individual they seek out to help them build that collective yes, truly matters, arguably as much as any other decision they make in driving that deal. For without the right partner inside the customer organization, they'll likely fail to build a bridge from me to we able to sustain anything more than the most watered down of deals. So who do they choose? That's where we turn next. But lest you think you can skip the next chapter if you're in marketing, listen on, as the story you're about to hear will have hugely important implications for the entire commercial organization, both sales Rep skill and marketing capability.\n",
